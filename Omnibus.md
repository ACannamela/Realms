# 1: General Player Information # {#general-player-information}

## 1.1: What is the Realms? ## {#what-is-the-realms}

The Realms is a medieval fantasy Live Action Role Playing (LARP) system (also
known as The Realms of Wonder). This game has been in existence since the late
1980s. The Realms has evolved considerably since its inception through the
participation and imagination of more people than can be credited. Unlike most
LARPs today, the Realms has a skill-based combat system, and is community-based
rather than run by a single, static council or corporation.

For those who are not familiar with what playing in a LARP entails, it is a lot
like acting. The difference is that while the event staff sets the stage, the
lines are all yours. You decide what "part" you want to play. Are you a mage, a
warrior, a noble, or all of the above? Once you arrive at the event site you
slip into your character. You stop acting like yourself and begin acting like
your new persona. The Realms uses foam-padded "weapons" to simulate combat and
has an intricate magic system to represent all sorts of things we wouldn't be
able to do in real life. The system is designed to help resolve situations that
we cannot practically resolve on our own. Specifics of the Realms system will be
discussed in more detail later on. You're in the Realms now and you'll never be
quite the same again.

## 1.2: What is This Book? ## {#what-is-this-book}

The document you are reading is the official rulebook to the Realms. Covered
here you will find what you need to know about combat, magic, and other aspects
of playing the game.

Be sure to know the 2018 Omnibus rules, as well as any specific rules at each
event you attend. At their events, an Event Holder (a player who volunteers to
run an event, hereafter referred to as an EH) may choose to change some of the
rules, including (among other things) announcing special weapon calls, defining
special event-specific spells (Regional Magic), and allowing play-testing of new
rules.

The game rules and the rulebook are updated once a year by a council of EHs in
order to make the game more fun, make the game safer, clarify existing rules,
and encourage increased, improved role-playing. For more information on events
and the Realms, visit [realmsnet.net](www.realmsnet.net).

## 1.3: How Do I Start Playing? ## {#how-do-i-start-playing}

First off, read this rulebook. Read the whole thing. It is also a good idea to
re-read the Omnibus each year so you can be up-to-date on rules modifications
and changes that occur during the Event-Holders Council.

Next, you will need to make a character (the role you play while at events).
Characters are often referred to as Player Characters or PCs. This role will be
the vehicle you experience the Realms through. Creating a character is old hat
to many who have played tabletop role-playing games or other LARPs. If you are
unfamiliar with creating a character or want some tips, see [Part 5: Character
Creation.](#character-creation)

After creating a PC, the best way to become acquainted with the Realms is to
simply go to an event. Most people will be happy to explain to you what's going
on. There is so much that can happen at an event that it is better experienced
than explained. Attending practices is also helpful, as you not only become
acquainted with the combat system, but also get introduced to other players.

### Realms Events ###

An event is where the game is played. There are basically three kinds of events
in the Realms: Feasts, Tournaments, and Quests. Some events take on qualities of
all the types, but are predominantly one of the three. Here is what to expect at
each type:

Feasts
: Feasts, as the name implies, revolve around food. Political posturing and
  court are often held at feast events. There is generally little combat at a
  feast event, and they are usually held indoors in the wintertime. Bardics,
  games of chance or skill, and other such activities can usually be found at
  feasts. Feasts are often a good starting point for some players, particularly
  those more interested in role-playing than in combat.

Tournaments
: Tournament events usually feature contests of both individual and team martial
  skill. These are usually held as yearly events, and are generally a social
  occasion. Players more interested in combat and less interested in
  role-playing and magic find tournament events the best starting point for
  their Realms careers.

Quests
: Quest events are the traditional style of event for saving damsels in
  distress, finding and killing evil demons, and many other tasks. Nearly
  anything can happen at a quest event.

## 1.4: Attending an Event ## {#attending-an-event}

### Registration ###

A list of events can be found on realmsnet.net under the Realms Calendar or the
Events tab. Whenever you plan on attending an event, you should register for it
through realmsnet.net as some events may have caps on how many players can
attend, while others may have different registration requirements or pre-event
information to disperse to players who are planning on attending. Registering
for events also helps give the event staff an idea of how many players they
might expect, and helps them to plan accordingly. It is also important to
register any dietary or medical restrictions you may have.

### Check In ###

When you arrive at an event, there are a few things you must do before beginning
play:

### Event Fees ###

You must pay any event fees; failure to do so means you will not be able
participate in the event and may be asked to leave site. Some events will waive
event fees for staff or NPCs (Non Player Characters) however, you must alway
check with the event holder first. As event fees help pay for the site, props,
prizes, food, and costuming that goes into throwing events, without them future
events would not be able to occur.

### Waivers ###

You may be required to sign a waiver. Waivers serve two purposes: protection
for the EH(s) or the land owners from legal action, and to keep track of how
many people attended an event. Monitoring event attendance is the way for the
Event Holders' Council to determine whether or not an event is legal (more on
what makes a legal event in [Part 7: Realms
Administration](#realms-administration)).

### Magic Items ###

Magic items must be checked in with the EH or the event's Magic Marshal (MM)
before the start of the event. EHs and MMs must know about every magic item at
an event, so that the event can be adjusted, if necessary. EHs and MMs have the
right to fail or disallow any magic item at any time. Using a magic item at an
event without first gaining approval by the EH or MM is cheating.

### Magic ### {#magic-check-in}

Spellcasters must check their spellbook with the EH or the event's MM to find
out whether any of their spells work differently at the event before they cast
any of their spells. Spellcasters with Regional Magic (see [Regional
Magic](#regional-magic)) also generally find out what their magic of the day is
at check-in. Using spells at an event without first gaining approval by the EH
or MM is cheating.

### Weapon Inspection ###

Before beginning play, you must inspect your own weapons before they are used.
If you are unsure of a weapon's safety, ask a marshal to inspect it for you. EHs
may require a designated marshal (referee) to inspect all weapons to make sure
they are safe for use. There must always be someone at an event who can be asked
to inspect weapons in case anyone does not feel comfortable inspecting their own
weapons. If a weapon is deemed unsafe, it is to be removed from play or
repaired.

## 1.5: Alcohol Policy ## {#alcohol-policy}

Alcohol is not permitted unless explicitly allowed by the Event Holder. An event
advertised as damp or wet is informing attendants that alcohol is allowed in
accordance with state and federal laws.

# 2: Core Rules # {#core-rules}

## 2.1: Participant Rights ## {#participant-rights}

The Realms is committed to providing a space that feels as safe and inclusive as
possible. Participants in the Realms have the out-of-character rights to
personal safety and the expectation they will be treated with courtesy and
respect by all other participants in the Realms. Participants have the right to
bring concerns to a marshal or other responsible staff member with the
expectation of having them investigated and appropriately addressed.

Every player has an obligation to read and follow the rules of the Omnibus. EHs
understand that the game can be complex and the first step in dealing with
behavioral issues or cheating in most instances involves ensuring that the
player understands the rules.

However, if a rule is broken, or if there are repeated infractions, an EH may
impose consequences on any participant(s) at their event. These may include a
formal warning; removal from specific sections of an event; removal from an
event; not being allowed to use specific weapons, spells, or items; or
prosecution for violations of Federal and/or State law. If you are removed from
an event for rules violations, the EH is not obligated to refund your event fee.

If an EH subjects a player to a consequence at their event they should notify
all other EHs of this via the Event Holders' List. The player involved must
receive a copy of this notification and may send a formal response. People who
want to bring formal charges should report such charges to the Arbitration
Committee (<arbitration@lists.realmsnet.net>). In addition, any participant that
feels wrongful action was taken against them can bring the issue before the
Arbitration Committee (see [Section 7.3](#arbitration-committee).

An EH may opt to not allow a player who has a history of breaking rules to
attend their events, provided that player is notified in advance.

Event Holders have an obligation to take reports of rules violations at their
events seriously. Having an additional person present during the reporting is
strongly encouraged. If you report a violation to the EH of an event and are
ignored or no reasonable action is taken, bring the situation to the attention
of the Arbitration Committee. Event Holders who have a history of disregarding
reports of rules violations, or who do not address especially serious reports
may face penalties including, but not limited to, temporary loss of EH status,
un-backing of that EH's magic item(s), revocation of an event's legal status,
and/or being banned from holding future events.

Reports of rules violations to be submitted after the conclusion of an event
should be submitted to the AC.

## 2.2: Code of Conduct ## {#code-of-conduct}

Anyone can report harassment or abuse. If someone's behavior towards you has
violated your rights as a participant, or if you witness the same happening to
someone else, immediately report the incident to the EH.

If you have reason to believe rules regarding the Code of Conduct may be
violated at an event, you should notify the Event Holder prior to the event
occurring.

The following list is not meant to be exhaustive, and any non-consensual
violations of a participant's rights should be considered a violation of the
rules.

Any of the following constitute grounds for punitive action:

* Violating any federal, state, or local laws, facility rules, or event
  policies;
* Failure to comply with the instructions of the Event Holder or designated
  marshal;
* Using anything in an out-of-character threatening or destructive manner
  against person or property;
* Endangering the safety of oneself or others;
* Stealing (People's tents, bags, packs, pouches, and possessions are completely
  off-limits and out-of-play. There are no exceptions, even if officially
  in-play items are concealed therein);
* Drinking alcohol under the age of 21, or providing alcohol to those under age
  21;
* Physical or verbal intimidation or abuse;
* Stalking;
* Inappropriate physical contact or proximity. Any form of unwanted physical
  contact is strictly forbidden;
* Non-consensual sexual acts (a person under the age of consent cannot consent
  to sexual acts);
* Inappropriate sexual attention, whether verbal or physical, or continued
  attention after being asked to stop (sexual attention towards those legally or
  physically unable to consent is always inappropriate, this includes people
  under the age of consent);
* Harassment for any reason, including out-of-game attributes such as race,
  weight, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or disability.

Role-play can never be used as an excuse for any of these behaviors. If you are
informed that your role-playing is OOC unsafe, threatening, or is not consented
to by other participants you should stop immediately and find another way to
play out the scene.

## 2.3: The Safety Rules ## {#the-safety-rules}

The safety rules are out-of-character (hereafter referred to as OOC). They are
for our safety, and provide the guidelines that we should all be playing by.

### The Rules We Play By ###

1. We should all be doing this to have fun. If you get mad or uncontrolled, it
   is up to you to remove yourself from the game until you have regained your
   composure.
#. This is a sport of personal honor; treat it as such. You are responsible for
   keeping track of many aspects of this game, such as weapon blows and known
   spells. Failure to report or accurately respond to any of these aspects is
   cheating and a stain on your personal honor.
#. You must listen to the marshals at all times; they are the referees. If you
   are caught breaking the rules, a marshal may remove you from all or part of
   that event.
#. Report any safety concerns to a marshal immediately. If you have any
   questions, it is up to you to ask.
#. HOLD: If you see a harmful or unsafe situation (e.g., someone is about to run
   into a tree, gets their glasses knocked off, has had their weapon really
   broken in combat, is about to fall off a cliff, etc.) yell the word "Hold."
   If someone is injured, it is the primary responsibility of the person who is
   hurt to call a Hold. Before calling a Hold for someone else in an otherwise
   safe situation, you must first ask if they are all right. Holds should only
   be called in the event of a dangerous situation, and should never be used to
   discuss the rules. If you hear the word "Hold," stop immediately, then say
   "Hold" until everyone else has stopped moving. Once the emergency has been
   dealt with, a "Lay-On" (continue play) will be called either by a qualified
   marshal, or the person who originally called the Hold. Do not resume play
   until a Lay-On has been called.
#. Only weapons and shields that have been made following the construction
   guidelines (see [Section 3.8: Weapon Construction](#weapon-construction)) are
   to be used. Weapons should be checked between combat situations to ensure
   continued safety. A qualified marshal may be requested to check the safety of
   any weapons or shields at any time. Any new designs or materials must be
   inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal before use.
#. There is to be NO real steel in any combat situation, or in any potential
   combat situation, at any time. Real steel is defined as metal knives, swords,
   axes, darts, spikes, spurs, etc. - anything that could really hurt a
   participant. Real steel that is sheathed is still a potential hazard.
#. Acts considered unlawful in the real world, such as theft of non-game items
   or assault, are also unlawful in the Realms. For the safety of all
   participants, any form of unwanted physical contact is strictly forbidden.
#. Any spell props, weapon props, or materials not specifically allowed within
   the Omnibus must be inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal
   before they are used.
#. While the wording of the game rules may occasionally be less than clear,
   players should not use any such confusion to their own advantage. A simple
   guideline is to not assume any benefits unless they are specifically granted
   by a rule. If you feel that the way a rule is written grants you an advantage
   by omission of a statement to the contrary, you must review that rule with a
   marshal or EH prior to utilizing that advantage. While this document has a
   lot of general rules (such as [Section 6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone
   Should Know](#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know)), any specific rule
   will always override these general rules.

### The Rules We Fight By ###

11. This is a lightest touch sport. ANY contact with a weapon to a body is to be
    taken as a hit. Ignoring a "light" blow is cheating and a marshal may remove
	you from the fight. There are to be NO full-strength swings. A marshal may
	remove you for excessive blow strength. Weapons, melee and missile, should
	be used with the minimum force necessary to score a successful hit.
#.  The face (eyebrows to chin) and throat area are "off-target." Do not aim for
    these areas. You may choose not to accept a blow that hits you solely in
	these areas, but you must call the location that was hit. For instance, if
	you are hit in the face, call "Face," and keep fighting if you wish. This
	alerts both the other combatant and the marshal that you have taken an
	illegal blow. It is not unusual for shots to an off-target area to also
	strike legitimate areas in the same strike. You must take all legal blows,
	even if an off-target area was hit by the same strike. For example, a shot
	thrown at your head may hit your face if you pull back, but if it touches
	your forehead in the process, that is a legal blow.
#.  In combat, there is to be contact with weapons only (e.g., weapons hitting
    weapons, weapons hitting bodies, and weapons hitting shields only). There is
	to be NO body contact of any kind (e.g., no shoving, punching, kicking,
	biting, grabbing, etc.). Do NOT grab an opponent's weapons and/or shield.
#.  Do NOT charge. Charging is defined as running at someone so that they have
    to get out of your way to avoid illegal contact.
#.  Shields are for blocking ONLY. Your shield should never be used as a weapon.
    Shield-bashing or other shield contact with another person is unsafe.
#.  Pommels, no matter how padded, are not legal striking surfaces. Do not punch
    or thrust with the pommel of a weapon.
#.  Do NOT ever throw a weapon at a participant, unless that weapon is of a type
    (magic missile, javelin, or lightning bolt) sanctioned by the rules for
	throwing. No thrown weapon or missile weapon should strike a participant
	above the shoulders.
#.  Arrows should be drawn with minimal pull necessary to score a successful
    hit. Bows should NEVER be used to parry an attack. As with thrown weapons,
	arrows should not strike a participant above the shoulders.

# 3: Combat in the Realms # {#combat-in-the-realms}

## 3.1: The Combat System ## {#the-combat-system}

The Realms uses a lightest-touch system for its combat system. That means that
no matter how lightly your opponent may touch you with their weapon, you have to
take the shot. This is to keep the sport friendly, so that everyone can play.
This system does not allow for "scratches" or "light blows" - you must take
these shots as normal blows. In all cases, the phrase, "if you are struck,"
refers to any time you are struck by the padded surface of any weapon or spell
prop that does damage as a weapon.

### Hit Locations ###

Your body is separated into seven locations of which there are two kinds. Your
arms and legs are "limbs," while your head and the front and back of your torso
are "kill locations." If you become confused about exactly where one location
stops and another begins, thinking of a Barbie™ doll may help. The buttocks of a
person are considered leg shots. If you are hit in the buttock(s), you lose the
appropriate leg(s).

### Killing Blows ###

If you are struck in a kill location your PC is dead (see [Section 3.4:
Character Death](#character-death) and [Section 3.5: Scalping](#scalping) for
more details).

If you are hit on the top of the shoulder, your PC is dead. If you are wearing
armor, a blow to the top of the shoulder is considered a blow to the front or
back depending on whether your opponent is in front of you or behind you.

### Limb Shots ###

If you are struck in a limb, your PC loses the use of that entire limb. If you
are struck in a limb that has already been lost, and that limb blocked what
could have possibly been a legal shot to another location, then that location
should be considered hit. You cannot protect the side of your PC's body with a
disabled arm or by lifting a disabled leg up to block. Once your PC's limb has
been disabled, it should be put behind you. This keeps it out of the way as well
as provides a visual cue to other players that your PC is hurt. Once you have
lost a limb, your PC cannot use that limb at all. Don't limp on a damaged leg.

### Hand-on-Weapon ###

If you are struck on a hand that is holding anything that is legal to block or
parry with (weapons and shields, but not bows, javelins or arrows), it is
considered gauntleted and immune to damage. When this happens, call out "Hand"
or "Hand-on-weapon." If you are struck on a hand that is not holding anything
you can parry with, even if you have just taken it off for a second, it is
considered a legal limb shot and your PC has to suffer the consequences. Your
hand is considered everything below the wrist bone.

### How to Take Multiple Hits ###

Should an opponent's weapon (be it a melee weapon, missile weapon, or spell
prop) hit you in more than one location with the same swing, all points of
contact count as hits.

## 3.2: Combat Etiquette ## {#combat-etiquette}

Combat is an important part of the game. In order to make the game more fun for
everyone, combat etiquette, which is OOC, has been developed. Using combat
etiquette helps avoid confusion and promotes the same kind of behavior when
someone else is fighting you.

### Calling Hits ###

It is your responsibility to call where you were hit in combat. This is to let
the other participant(s) and the marshals know that you were hit, and where you
were hit. Calling armor, protections, and other effects is also your
responsibility. Armor must always be called, even when a PC is dead. It is not
acceptable to call another player's hits for them. If you feel that another
participant is consistently miscalling their hits, missing shots, or some other
form of cheating, please alert a marshal. It is acceptable to ask your opponent
if they were hit, calling their attention to the location.

### Late Shots ###

Sometimes you will strike another participant immediately after receiving a hit
that injures or kills your PC. For example, just before your sword makes contact
with an opponent, your attacking arm is struck by another weapon. Even though
you are incapable of physically halting your attack, the injury your PC received
renders the hit ineffective. There is no "follow through" effect that allows
your attack to be successful. This is called a late shot. If you deliver a late
shot, it is your responsibility to inform your opponent to not take the blow.
Common phrasing includes "Don't take that!" or "Late, on your arm!" Like other
shots, you may not declare that someone else hit you late. If you think someone
is failing to call their late shots, question them after combat ends, or bring
your concern to a marshal.

### Illegal Hits ###

Sometimes you may hit someone with a part of your weapon that doesn't actually
damage their PC, such as the pipe of a weapon, the side of a thrust-only weapon
(see [Section 3.7: Weapon Rules](#weapon-rules)), or the shaft, fletching or
nock of an arrow or javelin. If you do this, be sure to call "Don't take that!"
to alert them that it wasn't a legal hit, and that they may resume play as if
the hit never occurred. A player may also call "shaft" if they received an
illegal hit from an arrow or javelin, or call "slash" if they received an
illegal hit from a thrust-only weapon.

### Missing Shots ###

Sometimes in the thick of battle people miss shots, because of adrenaline or
focus. This is generally unintentional and accidental. It often stops once a
fighter has more experience in calling and feeling their shots. Repeatedly
missing shots or intentionally missing shots is different and is cheating. If
you repeatedly miss shots, you may be asked to get retrained in fighting, or may
be asked to stop playing.

### Off-Target Areas ###

Your face and the front of your throat are off-target; players should never aim
attacks there. If you are hit in either location, you should announce it even
though the hit has no game effect. Face is considered the area on your head
below your eyebrows, in front of your ears. Throat is considered the
forward-facing section of your neck, above the sternum. The forehead from the
eyebrows up, the back and top of your head, and the sides and back of your neck
are all legal targets.

Should an opponent's weapon hit you in more than one location with the same
swing and one or more of those blows land in an off-target area (such as your
face or your throat), you still have to accept those blows which did land in
legal locations.

Breast shots and groin shots are legal and considered killing shots, but such
shots are highly discouraged. Everyone is encouraged to wear protective gear to
avoid injury to sensitive areas.

You should never deliberately aim for an off-target area (face with any weapon,
or head with a ranged weapon) or the groin or breasts. Accidents happen, but if
you frequently target these sensitive areas it will indicate to others that you
are not a safe and controlled fighter, and you may be asked to sit out by a
marshal.

## 3.3: Armor ## {#armor}

### Types of Armor ###

Your PC may be able to wear armor. Armor allows a PC to take blows without
taking injuries. There are two kinds of armor: heavy and light. Heavy armor will
absorb two blows per hit location before you have to take the shot. Light armor
will absorb one blow per hit location.

Light armor is a thin, pliable kind of armor. Light armor can be made out of
multiple layers of quilting or a moderate weight of leather. A quilted cloth
jerkin or a thin leather helmet are examples of 1-point armor. Garment-weight
leather (such as suede pants or moccasins) is not suitable for light armor.

Heavy armor is in general bulkier, rigid, and more cumbersome than light armor.
Hard-boiled leather, heavy-weight leather, studded leather/cloth, brigandine,
and chainmail/platemail are classic examples of 2-point armor. Any armor that is
studded must have at least one metallic component every square inch to count as
heavy armor.

Armor must allow you to feel blows through it and it must look like it would fit
in a medieval or fantasy setting. 

### Calling Your Armor ###

Armor protects by hit location, so if you have more than one piece of armor on a
hit location, it is all considered damaged when you are struck there. On the
other hand, if one piece of armor covers more 
than one hit location, it is treated as separate hit locations. The armor hit
locations are divided up by the hit locations for taking wounds and kills. Light
armor allows you to call out "Armor 1" on that hit location and the next blow
will do damage. If you are wearing heavy armor you should call out "Armor 1"
then "Armor 2" before the hit location takes damage. 

You can be wearing armor on a hit location yet still have some areas of that hit
location that are not covered. These sections are also considered armored if at
least 75% of the entire hit location is covered by armor. If some of that armor
is light and some is heavy then the uncovered areas can only call out "Armor 1".
If all of the armor on the hit location is heavy then then the uncovered areas
can call both points of armor. A marshal should be asked to rule whether or not
75% of the location is covered in any case where it is ambiguous.

For example, if you are wearing a thin leather upper-arm bracer and a metal
lower-arm bracer on your right arm, only a leather upper-arm bracer on your left
arm, and a chainmail shirt that goes down to your knees: a shot to anywhere on
your lower-left arm disables your PC's left arm. The upper bracer was not struck
and thus has no benefit. A shot to the upper portion of your left arm damages
the upper-arm bracer. Your PC still has the limb, but the armor on that limb is
gone. A shot to the lower-right arm bracer damages all the arm armor. You still
have a point of armor left on the lower bracer, but if you are hit on the
upper-right arm bracer, your PC will lose the limb. Had the next shot also hit
the right lower-arm bracer, all the right arm armor would be gone. Three shots
to a leg covered by the chainmail skirt would destroy all of the armor on that
leg and disable the PC's leg as well. Even though the armor protecting the leg
and the armor protecting the torso is all one piece, you can still take two
shots to the armor on your front torso, back torso, and your other leg before
the armor in those locations is completely destroyed.

## 3.4 Character Death ## {#character-death}

As players experience the game through the eyes of their characters, PC death
becomes an important aspect of the game.

### Death ###

Death occurs in many ways. Usually, death of a character happens when something,
such as a weapon, hits a character in an unarmored kill location. Certain spells
may also kill a character, from magic missiles to ingesting poisons or other
more esoteric means. Death renders the character incapable of any action until
such time as a spellcaster or item, with the power to heal the dead, raises the
character, or magic that regenerates or animates them takes effect.

Death can be repaired by many spells, abilities, and items. Be sure to go over
[Part 3: Combat in the Realms](#combat-in-the-realms) and [Section 6.1: Basic
Magic Effects Everyone Should Know](#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know)
for more details on what causes and cures death.

In the Realms there are two states of death. They are death (or dead), and
scalped (see [Section 3.5](#scalping) for more information on Scalping).

If your PC is dead or scalped, you should lie or sit still. Try not to look
around or talk. Do your best to role-play a corpse. Don't get upset if someone
hits you with a killing blow when you are already dead. If somebody does this
just say, "Dead." They are making sure that you really are dead.

In tournaments, or other high combat situations, it is acceptable for a
character to move out of the way to avoid being stepped on. They may resume
their death act in a safer place. They may also sit or kneel to avoid injuries.
If you are role-playing death in any of these forms, you should put your weapon
over your head to signify your character is dead.

If someone looks at you and asks you to describe your wounds, do your best to
comply. If you were backstabbed and you're lying on your back, tell them they
don't see any wounds. Then, if they roll you over to look at your back, tell
them they see a deep wound in your back.

When your PC is killed (dead, but not scalped) and then raised, they may
remember everything up until the point of their death.

### Playing Dead ###

It is legal for characters to lie down and pretend they are dead, but they may
not put their weapons over their head. If someone asks a player if their
character is dead, the player and the character are not obligated to answer, but
if a player is asked to describe their character's wounds, they should do so as
accurately and honestly as possible. If their character is not really dead and
someone comes close to them to loot their character's body, they are free to
attack the unsuspecting looters. If you are unsure as to whether someone's
character is dead and want the character to be, tap the player gently in a kill
location.

## 3.5: Scalping ## {#scalping}

Scalping is the removal of a character's life essence through mutilation of the
body. It is a more serious form of death that requires more than a simple spell
to repair. Scalped characters cannot be raised or animated until their soul has
been restored.

### Scalps ###

A scalp is a token carried by each player, which represents the life essence of
that player's character. Players must be carrying their PC's scalp at all times;
unless the PC is dead and scalped (see below), or unless they are under the
influence of a spell which removes the PC's scalp. Scalps must have their
player's name and the PC's name written legibly on it. A scalp does not exist
physically in the IC world therefore it cannot be searched. A scalp is a
non-magical and non-stealable marshaling tool.

### How Characters are Scalped ###

In order to scalp a body, you must strike 200 blows with a weapon beside the
body of the character being scalped. More than one person may scalp a body at a
time. More than one weapon may be used to scalp a body as well. This effectively
divides the number of blows to be struck between the number of participants and
number of weapons used. Some monsters and characters under certain spells may
require more scalping blows to completely destroy. If you strike 200 blows and
the victim says "The job is not yet done," then the scalping is not yet
complete. Some spells, such as [Strange Brew: Potion of Acid](#potion-of-acid)
and [Assassin's Blade](#assassins-blade), may accelerate the act of scalping.

After the scalping is finished, the player of the scalped character must present
their character's scalp to the character that just scalped them. It is then that
player's responsibility to present the scalp to an EH or an appointed marshal.
The EH must be informed immediately of the scalping, thus allowing the EH time
to prepare for those who might wish to return the scalped character to life.

Characters that are pretending to be dead should interpret any scalping blows as
blows to the closest kill location. So, if your PC is pretending to be dead and
someone starts to scalp them, the first blows that are struck on the ground next
to you should be played as if they were striking your PC on the nearest kill
location, destroying any undamaged armor, and then killing them.

If your PC is killed and scalped, they will not remember anything about how they
died should they manage to be raised.

Should your PC be dead at the end of an event without being raised, even if the
character was not actively scalped, the PC will be considered scalped.

### Fixing a Scalped Character ###

To restore someone to life after scalping, characters must first have the body
of the person needing to be raised. Then characters must either cast a [Call the
Soul](#call-the-soul), an [Intervention](#intervention) spell, or administer a
[Potion of Soul Snare](#potion-of-soul-snare) (see [Strange
Brew](#strange-brew)) to summon and reattach the scalp. If characters lack the
body, only an [Intervention](#intervention) spell will be able to return the
scalped PC back to life. When the body and scalp are reunited, characters must
cast one [Raise Dead](#raise-dead) spell for each event (including the first)
since the scalped PC was scalped in order to raise them. A different spellcaster
must provide each [Raise Dead](#raise-dead) spell used for this purpose.

## 3.6: Permanent Death ## {#permanent-death}

When a PC is dead and scalped at the end of an event at which they were at some
point alive, they get a "tick." PCs may also receive ticks due to use of certain
magic items or plot interactions. A PC is only obligated to accept one
involuntary tick per event. A PC that accumulates three or more ticks is
permanently dead, as their soul can no longer be restored by any means. On
January 1st of each new year, one tick is removed from each PC that has any,
unless they are already permanently dead. If a PC is killed and scalped during
an event, but returned to life before the end of the event, they do not get a
tick.

For a scalping to be official, it must be brought to the EH's attention. The EH
must provide the Death Marshal with this scalping information from their events.
A tick may only be issued or reported by a legal EH of the event where the tick
was incurred or by the player whose PC received the tick. The Death Marshal will
keep track of this information. The current Death Marshal is Keith Cronyn who
can be reached at <Keith.Cronyn@gmail.com> or at 603-819-8689.

## 3.7: Weapon Rules ## {#weapon-rules}

Players are responsible for being safe with the weapon(s) they are using. Before
using a weapon style in-game, players should take it upon themselves to be
properly trained by a marshal or someone who is safe and proficient with that
weapon style.

### Wielding Weapons ### {#wielding-weapons}

For the purposes of the rules, you are wielding a weapon or shield if you are
holding it in your hand(s) and you attack, parry, or block with it. You are
wielding a combination of weapons and/or a shield if you attack, parry, or block
with either of them. Simply holding a weapon, or menacing with it, does not
count as wielding unless contact is made. You cannot wield more than one item in
a hand at once.

If you are wielding an illegal weapon or combination and you attack, then you
should tell the target "Don't take that." If something you are not wielding
blocks a shot, then you should treat the blow as if it had landed. If you are
not sure where that blow would have landed, then assume it would hit the
location that would cause you the most harm (e.g., an unarmored kill location).
There are special restrictions for spellcasters in terms of wielding and
blocking with different weapons, and specific consequences for doing so outside
of the spellcaster's restriction. See [Breaking Weapon
Restrictions](#breaking-weapon-restrictions) for more information.

The size of a weapon dictates how it may be wielded. Weapons cannot be any
smaller than 12", and cannot exceed 8' in length.

+-------------+-------------------------+
| Length      | Weapon Type             |
+============:+:========================+
| 12" to 3'8" | One-handed              |
+-------------+-------------------------+
| 3'8" to 5'  | Hand-and-a-half         |
+-------------+-------------------------+
| 4' to 5'    | One-handed, no          |
|             | florentine, thrust-only |
+-------------+-------------------------+
| 5' to 6'6"  | Two-handed              |
+-------------+-------------------------+
| 6'6" to 8'  | Two-handed, thrust-only |
+-------------+-------------------------+

Table: Weapon Length Quick Guide

### One-Handed Weapons ###

You can wield a one-handed weapon or shield in one hand and still use another
one-handed weapon or shield in the other hand. Using two one-handed weapons (up
to 3'8" each) together, one in each hand, is commonly called a "Florentine"
combination. Magic Missiles are also considered one-handed weapons, but follow
special rules (see [Magic Missile](#magic-missile), under Spell Descriptions).

### Hand-and-a-Half Weapons ###

If a weapon is considered hand-and-a-half, then you can use the weapon with one
hand, but your other arm or hand cannot be holding a weapon or a shield.
Lightning bolts are also considered hand-and-a-half weapons. Bows are wielded as
hand-and-a-half weapons, but follow special rules (see [Bows](#bows) below).

### Two-Handed Weapons ###

If a weapon is two-handed, you may only wield the weapon with two hands. Every
blow you strike must be started with two hands. If you lose an arm while
wielding a two-handed weapon, you may not attack with that weapon. You may parry
with a two-handed weapon with only one hand, but only if you are not wielding
something else with your other hand.

Every blow you strike with a two-handed weapon must begin with both hands on the
weapon. If you let go with one hand during the swing, the swing is still legal.
Once the initial swing has ended, the attacker will have to grab the weapon with
two hands again before making another attack.

### Thrust-Only Weapons ###

Thrust-only weapons cannot strike an opponent with a "slashing" or side-to-side
motion. If you slash at an opponent with a thrust-only weapon, you must tell
them "Don't take that." As long as the tip of the weapon strikes with a forward
motion the blow must be taken. If you are not certain that a thrust-only strike
landed properly, you must assume it was a slash and tell your opponent not to
take the shot.

### Spears (Thrust-only) ###

A spear is a thrust-only weapon between 4' and 5' in length. These weapons may
be used as a single-handed weapon if used alone or with a shield. Spears may not
be used with other weapons. Their length must be between 1/3 to 1/2 covered in
foam and they must be clearly labeled with the word "Spear" on the blade. Once
being labeled as a spear the weapon must stay thrust-only even if it is legally
made to regular slashing hand-and-a-half standards.

### Bows ### {#bows}

A bow is wielded as if it were a hand-and-a-half weapon. This means that it may
not be held when a weapon or shield is being wielded in your other hand, but it
is legal to fire it with one hand— if you can! A bow is not considered a
"weapon" for purposes of determining whether a spell fails; arrows are
considered weapons and will cause some spells to fail.

Bows must have a draw-weight of 30 pounds or less. Just like melee weapons, you
should be careful on how hard your arrows are striking your opponent. Arrows
should be drawn with the minimal pull necessary to score a successful hit.

If a weapon hits a wielded bow or nocked arrow, the bow is "broken" and may no
longer be used in combat. Anyone can fix a broken bow by holding the bow with
both hands, then counting to 200 seconds. You cannot actively parry with a bow
or an arrow.

### Javelins ###

A javelin is wielded as if it were a single-handed weapon. This means that it
may be held when a weapon or shield is being wielded in your other hand. A
javelin is considered a weapon for the purposes of spells.

### Missile Weapons ###

Projectile weapons such as arrows, crossbow bolts, spells (like Magic Missile),
and javelins cannot be targeted at your opponent's head. Head shots from
projectile weapons, even if they did not hit the face or the throat, do not have
to be taken as legal shots.

Being struck with any portion of the foam head of the arrow or javelin will
cause damage. The shaft, fletching, and nocks of arrows and javelins do not
cause damage.

All projectile weapons, with the exception of arrows and javelins, are live and
inflict damage on any target they hit until they come to rest, regardless of
whether they hit the ground, a wall, a weapon, a tree, or any other obstacle
along the way. In the case of arrows and javelins, an arrow or javelin is
considered live and is able to inflict damage until it comes into contact with
the ground. If an arrow or javelin hits you after it comes into contact with the
ground it does no damage. It is the responsibility of the player wielding the
bow or javelin to tell you not to take the blow.  A player may also call "shaft"
if they received an illegal hit from an arrow or javelin.The length of javelins
and arrows are not subject to a spellcaster's weapon restriction.

## 3.8: Weapons Construction ## {#weapon-construction}

There are several ways to make weapons in the Realms. If you are playing for the
first time, it might be a better idea to borrow weapons than try to make any of
your own. Once you have seen what other weapons have looked like and asked a few
questions on how others have made their weapons, then you will be better
prepared to construct your own.

Be sure to follow these guidelines when constructing a weapon:
* All non-missile melee weapons must be made out of lightwall PVC, fiberglass,
  or bamboo cores as noted in the table below. There can be nothing in the core.
  Both ends must be capped with a rigid material.
* All weapons must have a thrusting tip (the pipe foam that extends beyond the
  tip of the pipe) as noted below.
* A weapon's striking surface must be made from closed-celled foam pipe
  insulation, which must be at least 5/8" thick and which must be firmly
  strapping-taped in place. All striking surfaces must be covered in either duct
  tape or fabric. Only magic weapons should be made with a blue-colored striking
  surface, and you may only make a magic weapon through the use of spells in the
  magic system, or if you are releasing one as an EH.

\* add 5" camp/yoga foam sleeve starting beneath the foam disk extending away

### Double-bladed weapons (including Marns) ###

* No surface of a double-bladed one-handed slashing weapon may be shorter than
  6".
* The overall (combined) foam length must still be at least half the length of
  the weapon.
* Each striking surface of a double-bladed slashing weapon of hand-and-a-half
  length or longer must be at least 1/3 the total weapon length.
* Weapons with a non-bladed portion longer than the shorter of the two blades
  must provide non-damaging covering foam or other padding as a courtesy to
  shield the exposed core.

### Arrows, Javelins, and other Missile Weapons ###

__T8 and Aqua Tube Arrows__

* All arrows must have 2" thrusting tips, 4" of pipe foam, and 2" squishy-foam
  tips to be considered safe.
* All arrows must be made from 3/4" or 1" diameter tubing.
* All arrow tube shafts must be capped on the arrowhead end of the shaft with a
  rigid material. Examples of acceptable cap materials include, but are not
  limited to, rigid plastics (such as milk jug caps or film canister caps) or a
  single washer (non-metal washer) or coin. Any such rigid materials must be
  appropriately sized to match the arrow shaft in diameter.
* Arrows may not be weighted in any way beyond the materials necessary for safe
  construction. Weighting includes the attachment of multiple rigid caps.
* All aqua tube shafts should, at minimum, be covered by two lengths of
  strapping tape.
* Lightning Bolt props are the only "arrow" props that should be made solely
  from white duct tape. Arrows may have a white head or shaft, but not both.
* Whether custom-designed arrows are allowed is up to the individual EH's
  discretion.

__LARP Arrows__

* Head must be permanently affixed, commercially manufactured, designed to be
  "larp safe" or "archery tag safe" with squishy foam, and have a minimum
  diameter of 2 1/8" on the striking surface.
* Shaft must be made from either unbreakable or safety fiberglass, covered in a
  minimum of 2 layers of fiberglass reinforcing tape (strapping tape), and be no
  longer than 28" measured from the end of the nock to the base of the arrow
  head.
* Nocks must be permanently affixed and must be manufactured and designed to be
  "larp safe" or "archery tag safe".

[__Lightning Bolts__]{#lightning-bolt-construction}

A Lightning Bolt prop is an arrow or javelin made with the following additional
details:

* It must be primarily white. 
* It must be between 2'6" and 3'6" in length. The prop is not subject to the
  spellcaster's weapon length restriction.
* It must have the words "Lightning Bolt" and the spellcaster's name written
  visibly along the shaft.
* It cannot have an arrow nock.
* It must not have the word "Javelin" on it if it is a javelin prop.

__Javelins__

* Javelins may be constructed using golf tubes or aqua tubes with foam coverage
  on at least 1/3 the weapon length.
* Javelins cannot be nocked, and must have foam coverage on the non-damaging end
  of the shaft.
* Javelins must be made from new pipe foam and must have squishy-foam heads.
* Any fletching added must be made out of foam, and the javelin may not be
  weighted in any way.
* Javelins must be between 2'6" and 5' in length.
* The word "Javelin" must also be written on the side of the weapon.

## 3.9: Shield Construction ## {#shield-construction}

* Shields must be at least 12" long (as measured by the longest dimension). A
  shield may be as large as you like, but you as an individual must be able to
  safely wield it. A marshal or EH can pull a shield if they feel it is unsafe.
* Shields can be made of any safe material, such as wood, plastic, or cardboard.
  Metal shields are heavy, but are allowed if otherwise safe.
* All shields must have their edges covered by foam. Any protruding metal screws
  or bolts should also be padded.

## 3.10: Equipment Inspections ## {#equipment-inspections}

You must inspect any armor, weapon, or shield before using it. If you are unsure
about an item's safety, ask a marshal and they will inspect it for you. Any item
can be inspected at any time during an event at anyone's request. This is meant
for the purpose of ensuring safety and should never be used for strategic or
tactical purposes. The EH or a designated marshal retains final ruling on the
approval for use of any armor, weapon, or shield.

### Armor Inspection ###

Armor can be failed or the point value of armor may be adjusted for many
reasons. Armor can have exposed edges that could cause a safety concern for the
wearer or other combatants. The EH or designated marshal retains final ruling on
the point value and approval for use of armor.

### Shield Inspection ###

Shields can be failed for many reasons. A shield can have exposed edges or
protrusions that could cause a safety concern for the wearer or other
combatants. A shield can be failed if it has seen too much abuse and has not
been repaired recently. The EH or designated marshal retains final ruling on the
approval for use of a shield.

### Weapon Inspection ###

Weapons can be failed for many reasons. A weapon can have too much "whip" (one
that flexes too much) or not enough "whip" (one that doesn't flex at all). There
is no standard way of measuring flex, you will have to use your common sense. A
weapon can be failed if it has seen too much abuse and has not been repaired
recently. The most common problem weapons have is that their thrusting tips are
breaking down or have been compacted. The EH or marshal retains final ruling on
the approval for use of a weapon.

## 3.11: Combat Calls ## {#combat-calls-section}

Combat calls are what you may hear yelled in combat, and you must know how these
calls affect your PC.

### Armor ###

Negates a hit attack. When "Armor" (or "Armor 1," "Armor 2," or "Armored Cloak")
is called in combat, it means that the person calling armor is protected against
the attack that landed on them, usually by means of armor or a spell effect.

### Armor-Piercing ### {#armor-piercing}

Armor cannot always protect a PC from certain attacks. If an opponent attacks a
PC in any way and calls out "Armor-Piercing," any of the armor that is struck by
the attack is completely destroyed, and the PC suffers the effect of the blow as
if they were not wearing armor. For example, if a PC is wearing heavy armor on
their right arm, and an opponent hits it while calling "Armor-Piercing," the
PC's armor is destroyed on that arm and they lose the limb.

### Boulder ### {#boulder}

A PC can encounter a boulder call in one of two ways: being hit with a physical
boulder prop or by a weapon simulating the effects of a boulder. In either
instance, the same call of "Boulder!" is used.

If you or any of your equipment are hit by the call of "Boulder!", you suffer
the following effects: your character is dead, any armor hit is "broken" where
the boulder touched the locations, magic items hit by the boulder are
disenchanted, and any non-monetary equipment (i.e. non-enchanted weapons, bows,
and shields) that is hit by the boulder is "broken." It is the player's
responsibility to see that items damaged this way are not used until the
appropriate repair spells are cast upon them.

A boulder prop is often represented by throwing large duct-taped chunks of foam
or beanbag chairs with the zippers duct-taped over. When thrown, the boulder is
active until it comes completely to rest. PCs may not throw or pick up boulders.
Four or more PCs, using a total of eight hands on the boulder, may work together
to "push" a boulder along, to free trapped gear and companions, but not to cause
damage.

### Disease ### {#disease}

If a weapon strikes a PC and the wielder calls "Disease," wounds on their body
take twice as many spells to be healed until the disease is cured. This effect
only damages a PC, not their armor. For example, if you are hit by a diseased
blow to the leg, [Heal Limb](#heal-limb) would need to be cast twice on the leg
for it to be healed until the disease is cured. Similarly, if you are killed by
a disease shot, the spell [Raise Dead](#raise-dead) will need to be cast twice
on you until you are cured of the disease.

Regeneration effects will still affect a diseased character with a single use,
but the regeneration time is doubled until the disease is cured. Disease can
affect both living and dead characters.

### Fireball ### {#fireball}

If you or any of your equipment are hit by the call of fireball, your character
is dead. Armor and weapons hit by the fireball are not broken, but also do not
protect against its damage. 

The fireball call may come in the form of a thrown prop (as with a magic
missile) or as a weapon blow. Fireball is magical in nature.

### Flat ### {#flat}

To "knock out" an opponent, the attacking player must call out the word "Flat"
prior to their attack. Should a successful killing blow be struck, they have
instead rendered their foe unconscious for a steady count of 300 seconds. The
unconscious PC may be wakened sooner by having another PC come and wake them up
by touching the unconscious PC and saying "Wake Up." The PC can also wake up
when any damage is inflicted on them. You may call "Flat" at any time, even in
the middle of a fight. This form of attack deals no damage to armor.

### Impale ### {#impale}

Impaling is the act of holding a weapon in an opponent's kill location after
death, and saying the word "Impale." It counts as continuous, non-scalping blows
to that location. The act of impaling will bypass any armor, damaged or not.
While impaled, a character cannot be raised or animated and is unable to
regenerate. The results can vary when impaling NPCs.

### Lightning Bolt ### {#lightning-bolt-call}

If you are hit by any part of a white boff arrow and the thrower calls
"Lightning Bolt," your PC is struck as if by a magic armor-piercing weapon (see
the [Magic](#magic-call) and [Armor-Piercing](#armor-piercing) calls in this
section).

### Poison ### {#poison}

There may be occasions where a PC is struck with a blow and the wielder calls
"Poison." If this strike damages a PC in any location, be it torso, arm, leg,
etc., then the PC is killed. When the blow does no damage to a PC, such as a hit
to an off-target area or a hit to armor that protects the PC, then the poison
has no effect. Armor struck with a poison blow is still used. If a PC is under
the effects of a spell that protects them from poison in some fashion, the PC
still takes the normal damage from the blow but the poison will have no
additional effect. Players should also call "Immunity to Poison," to allow an
opponent to understand that you recognized that the blow was poisoned.

### Weapon Type and Material Calls ### {#weapon-type-and-material-calls}

Occasionally, more powerful monsters are only affected by certain weapon types
or by certain materials. For example, axe-mace trolls are typically only injured
by axes and maces; werewolves are only affected by weapons made of silver. It
might be a good habit when using a melee weapon other than a sword, to call the
type of weapon you are using as you swing. If using a mace, say "Mace" with each
swing. When you are wielding a non-normal weapon (e.g., magic or silver), that
weapon will always strike with the same effect therefore you must call that
effect with every swing.

### Magic ### {#magic-call}

If a weapon strikes you and the wielder calls "Magic" (or "Magic Missile"), it
means your PC has been hit with a magical blow. Generally, being hit by magic
doesn't affect your PC any differently than being hit by a normal weapon, but
sometimes PCs are under spell effects where it makes a difference.

### Silver ### {#silver}
If a weapon strikes you and the wielder calls "Silver" it means your PC has been
hit with a silver blow. Being hit by silver doesn't affect your PC any
differently than being hit by a normal weapon.

# 4: Non-Combat Interactions # {#non-combat-interactions}

## 4.1: In-Character and Out-of-Character ## {#in-character-and-out-of-character}

### Being In-Character ###

Generally, events officially begin after the safety rules, any specific site
rules, and other special event rules have been read aloud to the gathered
players.

Once an event has begun, you are expected to be in-character (IC) at all times.
This means that you are playing your PC the whole time you are at an event.
Staying IC can add greatly not only to your own event experience, but to those
who are playing the game around you. When a companion of your PC is "killed" it
adds to the tension and drama of the scene if they pretend they are dead, but it
breaks the mood completely if they are laughing and making comments.

Your character may feel differently than you do about something, like slavery,
magic, politics, or religion. You may be a pacifist, while your character is a
bloodthirsty barbarian. If you can remain true to the character, despite your
differences, you can make a memorable story for yourself and those around you.
Sometimes staying IC is challenging, especially when you know something that
your character shouldn't logically know, but you should try to remain IC when
playing. Likewise, when the game is done, leave your character behind.

### Breaking Character ###

Once an event has begun, breaking character should be done only when necessary.
If you must do so, what you say should be prefaced with "Out-of-character," as
in "Out-of-character, where is the tenting area?" That way, the person you are
addressing knows that it is a real-world concern, and should be dealt wit
 differently than a strictly IC concern.

Sometimes when players get really into character, you may begin to wonder
whether animosity or other emotions are completely IC. It is acceptable to break
character to make sure everything is in fact still IC and no one's feelings are
getting hurt OOC.

### Out-of-Character-Only Terms ###

There are a few terms that should only be used when speaking OOC: “Hold” and
“Medic.” Hold is only used in emergencies as it stops the game. Read [Section
2.3: The Safety Rules](#the-safety-rules) for more information on the correct
use of the word Hold. Medic is used when someone needs immediate real-world
medical attention for any reason: an allergic reaction to a bee-sting, a twisted
ankle, an asthma attack, etc. Do not call “Medic” for imaginary (IC) injuries.
If you need IC medical attention, call "Healer!"

### Out-of-Play Areas and Time-Out ###

The EH has the option of declaring portions of the event site as "out-of-play"
for safety reasons or for NPC use. Never use these out-of-play areas as safe
havens.

If a fight breaks out in an area that is unsafe to fight in or that is
out-of-play, then the fight should be moved to a safe in-play area. If you are
in such an area, you may be asked to leave said area for combat. If you refuse
to leave the unsafe area, your PC is considered dead. After the fight, those
involved can move back to where the fight "really" took place, and continue on.

An EH is free to create an in-game safe area if they choose. For example,
powerful enchantments on the tavern may render weapons and hostile magic
inoperable within the tavern walls. In this case, it is fine for players to hide
there, since they will be taking advantage of an in-game effect.

EHs may also declare a time-out during an event for sleep, dinner, etc. While on
an event site, if you are not acting as an NPC at the EH's request, or you are
not in a time-out, a character is liable to be attacked, and their possessions
open to theft.

## 4.2: Dragging ## {#dragging}

To drag a dead, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated body in our game, you
must place a hand on the shoulder, back, or arm of the body and say "Drag." The
player being dragged must then get up and walk with you, bringing what they are
carrying with them. Stealable items stay on a dragged corpse unless explicitly
searched off. A dragged body is considered one-handed and may not be used as a
weapon or a shield. At any time you may tell the dragged player "Drop," thereby
letting go of the player and dropping them on the ground. A body being dragged
can never be "thrown" or "tossed." If the person dragging the body lets go, then
the body should drop in place.

## 4.3: Searching and Theft ## {#searching-and-theft}

There are certain items that are referred to as being "Stealable." Some examples
of stealable items are magic items, magic weapons, Realms currency, silver
weapons, and occasionally non-magical items. With the exception of currency, the
word "Stealable" is likely written somewhere on the object.

Players must assume that any props or items used by event staff are not
stealable unless labeled as such or told otherwise by event staff.

### Searching ###

Searching is a touchy subject. In the real world, if a bandit has just killed
someone they can just take everything they own. In the Realms, an object has to
be considered stealable to be taken from a person or location without the
owner's permission. The problem is that often these stealable items are not
easily recognizable, especially the smaller items. Also, while "secret pockets"
and such seem like a good idea at first, frisking a dead character could be
considered a form of harassment towards the player and should be avoided. To
handle this situation, the searching rule exists.

The searching rule is verbose because there have been a lot of problems about
searching in the past. The rule is mostly common sense. Once you think about it,
it will seem quite simple. There are two ways you can search someone, using a
Point Search or Full Search.

### Point Search ###

To simulate ransacking a character's pouches, weapons, and clothing quickly, a
player can "point search." Essentially, the searcher says "Search" and tells the
victim where they are searching (e.g., "I search your pouch.") If there are
stealable items in the area being searched, then all the items in that area are
handed over immediately. The area that a person point-searches cannot be any
larger than one hit location on the body (e.g., you would have to search each
sleeve of a shirt and the front and back of a shirt to search everywhere inside
the shirt). Pockets and pouches have to be pointed out to be searched. You
cannot say "I'm searching all your pockets," you have to search each one
individually; left and right sleeves, boots, gloves, etc., all have to be
searched separately, one at a time. Only one person can point search a victim at
a time. Point searching does not wake up an unconscious character.

### Full Search ###

The other way to search someone is to simulate taking your time to do it
thoroughly. That is, the character simulates stripping the body from head to
toe, ripping everything to shreds, garnering every last item you own, etc. In
order to do this the searcher simply says "Full search." Every stealable item
the victim has must be handed over to the searcher. The characters should take
120 seconds to do this. If so, then the items should be considered the IC
possessions of the searching character. Full searching will wake up an
unconscious character.

If someone full-searches a character and a different character comes by during
that time and point-searches the victim, the full search is stopped and the
point search is resolved. If a character does not specify what kind of search
they are performing, then it is assumed that they are performing a point search.
If told only that they are being searched, the player whose character is being
searched must assume it is a point search and respond, "Where?"

### Realms Thieves ###

The only objects that are always in-play, are fair game for theft, and can be
stolen without consulting the bearer of the object, are those considered
stealable in-game (see [Section 4.4: In-Game Items](#in-game-items), below). In
order to steal any other object, you must have the explicit permission of the
owner/bearer before making the theft. This means that to steal another PC's
jewelry (assuming that some of it is considered treasure), you must ask the
person who plays that PC. One way to do this is to kill or flat the character
and tell them that you are searching them. If they have anything that is
in-play, they must show it to you, for you to take or leave as you wish. You
should never pick up something off a table or from in front of someone's tent,
unless it is a magic or silver weapon, or Realms currency.

It should be restated that people's tents, bags, packs, and pouches are
completely off-limits and out-of-play. No matter how many magic or silver
weapons, or how much Realms currency someone might have, you may never, under
any circumstances, enter their tent or go into their bags, packs, or pouches and
take anything out without the owner's explicit permission.

A magic item is the property of the EH that created it. It is the EH's will that
the item be able to be circulated around the Realms by theft, as a gift, as part
of an inheritance, or any other means so long as it occurs at an event.

IC theft, not gift, of stealable items in OOC situations, not at an event, is
not acceptable and will not be upheld.

## 4.4: In-Game Items ## {#in-game-items}

### Currency ###

Various groups and nations issue different currencies for use as treasure and to
pay for goods and services in-game. These currencies are often represented by
stamped metal disks or roofing tins, sometimes bearing printed stickers for
identification or are minted in metals, plastic or even clay. In-game these
currencies usually represent Gold or Silver. Denominations vary from currency to
currency. Generally ten silver pieces are worth one gold piece. The more prized
issues are backed, meaning that if you accumulate enough of any one currency,
you can trade those coins in to the issuer for goods, weapons, or services. Many
older coinages and silver pieces are not backed, and while they're still
in-play, many people either heavily discount them or don't accept them at all.
Issues and worth of coins fluctuate. If you're in doubt as to what a coin is
worth, ask the merchants and the gamblers. Realms currency cannot be
counterfeited; to do so is cheating.

### Silver Weapons ###

Silver weapons are created by players with the spell [Reforge](#reforge) or are
released by EHs.

### Magic Items and Magic Weapons ###

All magic items and magic weapons are stealable.

Magic weapons must be made with a blue-colored striking surface, so that they
are distinctive. No permanent magic item may be issued by anyone except an EH
(see [Section 7: Realms Administration](#realms-administration) for more
information).

Should a magic item or weapon become broken or disenchanted at an event, it
requires a repair through the [Reforge](#reforge) spell to return to a
functioning state. Additionally, magic items which have been revoked by their
EH/creator are no longer considered magic items and also revert back to the EH
who created them. Magic weapons that are currently in existence may be re-bladed
without the use of a [Reforge](#reforge) spell, to repair safety issues, by
first contacting and gaining permission from the issuing or backing EH.

### Event-Stealable ### {#event-stealable}

The props for certain spells and items as designated by the EH are considered
"Event-Stealable," meaning that they are stealable treasure during an event, but
should be returned to their OOC owner when you leave an event. Before you leave
an event site, you must return (to the best of your ability) any items marked as
"Event-Stealable" to the EH or MM. Props for PC spells are returned by the EH or
MM as an OOC courtesy, and will be done so without revealing the identity of the
thief. If you have a spell that has an event-stealable prop as a component, you
may replace it without penalty at the next event if it is not returned to you
for whatever reason. You can never declare permanently stealable items as
event-stealable.

# 5: Character Creation # {#character-creation}

## 5.1: The Social Structure ## {#the-social-structure}

The Realms is not governed by a single kingdom. Each nation has its own
hierarchy and structure. There are no hard rules for governing the social
structure. Claiming land and titles is anyone's prerogative. The social
structure really only has one rule: if you can back up your title or claim then
you deserve to hold it. If you can't, then you should have nothing to complain
about if you get put in your place.

## 5.2: Creating a Character ## {#creating-a-character}

If you are already familiar with role-playing in general, or with live action
role-playing specifically, you probably already know how to make a character. If
you are new to the concept of role-playing, the following questions might help
you establish the traits and characteristics of your PC. You should try to
answer the questions for yourself, but some suggestions are provided.

_What is your character's species?_ There are as many species available in the
Realms as there are minds to create them. In the Realms, there are no
restrictions on what species you can play. The only rule is that you may gain no
special benefits or specialized abilities for playing a certain race or person
(the only way to gain supernatural powers is through legally released items,
the spell system, or by being appointed a _Knight of the Realms_ or a _Knight
of the Eternal Flame_). If you create your own "race," you would do well to
consider its mannerisms, average age, codes of ethic, etc. Of course humans are
the easiest to play, since you are probably human.

_What is your character's age?_ If you are playing a human character, it is
usually best to pick an age near your own. Other species may have different
average ages.

_Why is your character an adventurer?_ Most people of the Realms prefer the
relatively safe life of a farmer or craftsman. Why has your character left home
to join in the rather hazardous occupation of hero? The answer to this might
give you some valuable insight into the persona of your character.

_What is your character's background?_ There is no limit on where your character
came from. As was stated before, your character can come from anywhere, so long
as they gain no IC benefits from it.

_Does your character have a lifetime goal, dream, or driving force?_ Goals
define characters well, and how far they are willing to go to attain that goal
rounds them off.

## 5.3: Fighters ## {#fighters}

Fighters are capable of using any weapon style, to the limits of the [Wielding
Weapons](#wielding-weapons) section. They may use up to 2-point armor (heavy
armor) for each hit location. They are not considered enchanted beings unless
stated in the [Enchanted Beings Caveat](#enchanted-beings).

## 5.4: Being a Realms Spellcaster ## {#being-a-realms-spellcaster}

### Basics ###

The magic system is based on a simple path setup. There are many different paths
available to a spellcaster, with each path consisting of a list of spells. A
spellcaster may choose to take as many as three paths of spells as they
progress, with weapon use becoming more restricted as the number of paths
learned increases. Being a spellcaster requires two things: a spellbook and
knowledge of the magic system.

### Spellbooks ###

All spellcasters must have a spellbook, which records details of the spells the
spellcaster knows. It is a marshaling tool and cannot be stolen from the PC. A
spellcaster must have their spellbook on their person in order to cast spells.

* The beginning of each spellbook must have the spellcaster's IC and OOC name,
  their current weapon restriction, whether the spellcaster wears armor or not,
  and whether the spellbook is IC or OOC (see below).
* Next, the spellbook must have a listing of each spell the character has
  learned, in order; each spell's circle; the date each spell was learned; and
  a note if any spell is unlearned.
* The spellbook must have a description of each spell known - including specific
  components learned for each spell - to which the spellcaster may refer as
  needed during play.
* Lastly, the spellbook must list who taught the spell to the spellcaster on
  either the page of the spell's description or the spell list.

Spellcasters may have a Spell Mastery section at the end of their spellbook. The
Spell Mastery section is a list of spells which the spellcaster has learned
during their PC's lifetime. An entry in this list includes the spell's name, who
taught the spell to the spellcaster, and the date it was learned. Spells in this
list cannot be cast, unless they are currently in a spellcaster's path.

Spellbooks may be declared IC or OOC, and so noted on the title page ("IC" or
"OOC" in large, clearly written letters). Any change in a spellbook's IC or OOC
status must take place between events, but requires no particular time to make
any such change.

If a spellbook is declared IC, it can be read by other characters, and found and
perused in a search. Spellcasters have no option to refuse to reveal their IC
spellbooks, provided they are legally found in a search of the spellcaster's
person.

If a spellbook is declared OOC, the information summarized above is OOC
information only and exists solely as a marshaling tool. It cannot be read by
other characters or discovered in a search. Other information written in
spellbooks may be read by others, at the owner's discretion, such as rune sets,
history, or lore.

A player may choose to or need to replace their character's spellbook. This
could be due to such situations as loss, damage, illegibility, or a simple
desire to improve it. The player should create a new spellbook with contents as
close as possible to the prior one. In the case of swapping out an old spellbook
which is still available, the required information in it must be copied over to
the new one. In the case of the old spellbook being unavailable or unreadable,
then the player must make their best effort to recreate the information in the
original. At the next event where they play that character, they must inform the
Event Holder or Magic Marshal and have it inspected. At the beginning of the
spellbook, where their names and weapon restriction is written, they should note
that they are replacing their spellbook along with the date and the signature of
the inspecting Event Holder or Magic Marshal.

In all cases, spellbooks remain non-stealable items.

### Knowledge of the Magic System ###

All spellcasters are responsible for knowing how the magic system works,
specifically the spells they can cast. A spellcaster who misuses their spells is
not allowed to claim ignorance as an excuse.

### Spell Resets ###

During some Realms events, you may be told a spell reset has occurred. This
means some portion of your magical resources have been restored to your PC. The
specific effects of a spell reset will change from event to event, so be sure to
ask the EH or MM for details.

### Checking In ###

As mentioned previously, a spellcaster must check in their spellbook with the EH
or the appointed MM before using or learning spells (see [Section 1.4: Attending
an Event](#attending-an-event) for more details).

### Weapon Restrictions and Magic ###

Weapon restrictions are a matter of game balance. See below:

+----------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Level    | Paths    | Single Weapon or   | Florentine, Weapon | Bow or Javelin     |
|          |          | Shield             | & Shield           |                    |
+==========+==========+====================+====================+====================+
| Light    | 1 Path   | 4'6" maximum       | 5' combined length | Allowed            |
+----------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Medial   | 2 Paths  | 3' maximum         | 3'6" combined      | Allowed            |
|          |          |                    | length             |                    |
+----------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Severe   | 3 Paths  | 18" maximum        | Not allowed        | Not allowed        |
+----------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Table: Weapon Restriction Levels

Your weapon restriction changes the moment you learn an additional path of
magic. Spellcasters starting out know only one path (as they only know a single
spell), and thus their restriction is Light.

_For example:_ Roderick is currently a one-path with five spells. He decides
that using a bow and having more magic is more important than his
hand-and-a-half, so he decides to keep learning spells. As soon as he learns his
6th spell, his restriction changes over to being Medial.

### Breaking Weapon Restriction ### {#breaking-weapon-restriction}

A spellcaster may carry any weaponry they want, as long as they don't wield
them. In this context, wield means to make use of the weapon in any way,
including hitting someone or blocking a blow, whether intentional or not. To
wield a weapon outside of your weapon restriction is called "breaking weapon
restriction." (See [Wielding Weapons](#wielding-weapons) in [Section 3.7: Weapon
Rules](#weapon-rules).

If a spellcaster purposely breaks their weapon restriction, they suffer the
consequences of their actions. They immediately lose all of their spells and
become a fighter. Any lingering effects, such as [Circle of
Protection](#circle-of-protection) (but not a [Circle of
Healing](#circle-of-healing) or [Mystic Forge](#mystic-forge)), last until
broken or when spells next reset before going away. They are no longer a
spellcaster, and function as a non-spellcaster in all ways for a minimum of one
year. After that year is over, they may then decide to return to being a
spellcaster, but must start over from scratch.

If they break their weapon restriction without realizing it, such as a blow
being blocked by a weapon they are carrying for a friend, they have the option
of either the previous penalty or taking the blow that was blocked. This
decision must be made immediately.

### Armor ###

Armor restrictions are a matter of game balance. Spellcasters may only use light
armor (1-point) but at a cost to wear it. See below:

+--------+-------+------------------------+
| Level  | Paths | Cost                   |
+========+=======+========================+
| Light  | 1     | Free                   |
+--------+-------+------------------------+
| Medial | 2     | Top spell in each path |
+--------+-------+------------------------+
| Severe | 3     | Top spell in each path |
+--------+-------+------------------------+

For example, a spellcaster with two paths would be able to have 1st through 4th
and 2nd through 5th, and call armor. This may only be done once; you cannot
sacrifice the two highest spells of each path in order to be able to wear heavy
armor. A spellcaster may choose to start their spellcasting career with this
ability, in which case it must be noted in their spellbook. If not, they must
spend one event without learning a spell for each path they know in order to
gain the ability to wear armor. Similarly, it takes one event without learning a
spell or changing weapon restrictions to give up wearing armor and regain the
ability to learn their sacrificed spells.

If a Light restriction spellcaster learns more spells and becomes a Medial
restriction spellcaster, upon learning their first spell in their second path,
they must choose to either lose the ability to wear armor or their 5th circle
spell in their first path.

A spellcaster who uses armor (calls "Armor" in response to a blow) in violation
of their armor restriction is immediately faced with the same consequences as
one who has broken their weapon restriction, and should refer to that section
for details.

## 5.5: Multiple Characters ## {#multiple-characters}

You may have more than one character in this game. However, you may only play
one PC per event unless you have EH permission to play multiple characters.

## 5.6: Knights and Knightly Powers ## {#knights-and-knightly-powers}

There are many knighthoods in the Realms. It is a great honour to be appointed
as a knight, and sometimes this honour comes with special powers. For their
service to the game, a Knight of the Eternal Flame may, once per calendar year,
call "Knight" to protect themselves from one attack. A Knight of the Realms is
allowed to do this once per event. Event Holders may choose to grant powers to
members of other knighthoods.

# 6: Magic in the Realms # {#magic-in-the-realms}

## 6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone Should Know ## {#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know}

Even if you are not a spellcaster, and have no desire to become one, there is
still some basic information that you are responsible for understanding. In
nearly all cases, a spellcaster casting a spell on your PC should explain,
either through their VC or as an aside to you, how the spell affects your PC.
Even fighters should read the magic system and spell descriptions, so they have
a basic understanding of magic in the game and how it might affect them. No
spell effect may be ignored unless otherwise specified in the spell system.

The following are some rules about spells that can have an effect on your
character on a day-to-day basis. They are included here with some basic
information about how they affect you both IC and OOC.

### Healing Spells ###

When your character is injured or killed, only magic can fix the damage. To
raise a character means to return a character to life. Raising a character
repairs any injuries to limbs the character may have taken prior to their death
and also nullifies the effects of any poisons in their system at the time of
their death.

* [Combat Raise Dead](#combat-raise-dead): this three-word spell will raise a
  character.
* [Cry of Life](#cry-of-life): the call of "All in the sound of my voice, rise
  and fight" raises all dead who hear it.
* [Group Healing](#group-healing): allows a spellcaster to make a large circle
  through which they cast a healing spell upon every character in it.
* [Heal Limb](#heal-limb): this spell allows one wounded limb to be magically
  healed. The spellcaster will let you know when your character's limb has been
  repaired.
* [Raise Dead](#raise-dead): this spell raises a character. This spell will not
  work if there is a weapon within 10 feet of the spellcaster. Inform a
  spellcaster the spell has failed if you know about a weapon near enough to
  disrupt the spell. A bow is not considered a weapon, but arrows are considered
  weapons.

### Regeneration ### {#regeneration-bmeesk}

Some spells grant the ability to regenerate from death. This takes 120 seconds.
While this happens, your wounds begin to heal. Until 120 seconds have passed,
this grants no benefit. A blow to any kill location on a dead body will cause a
regeneration count to reset no matter where the killing blow was inflicted.
[Impaling](#impale) stops regeneration; the count resets when the weapon is
removed. Regenerating from death heals all healable wounds on the body. If
examined by another person, wounds can be seen to be regenerating. If you are
[diseased](#disease), it takes twice as long to regenerate. The effect ends when
you are raised.

### Combat Spells ###

Certain combat calls (see [Lightning Bolt](#lightning-bolt-call) and [Magic
Missile](#magic-call) in [Section 3.11: Combat Calls](#combat-calls-section))
involve a prop that is thrown at a combatant. After the prop has come to rest it
is only a physical representation of magic and cannot be moved or touched other
than by the person who threw it. It may be seen and guarded but not purposefully
hidden (e.g., putting a bucket over it). The prop is not considered a weapon and
does not cause [Spell Failure](#spell-failure) except while the spell is active
(i.e. from when the prop is thrown until it comes to rest).

### Undeath ###

Certain spells make your character undead for their duration. Your character
will remember what happened to them while they were undead. While undead, your
character cannot cross a [Circle of Protection](#circle-of-protection), other
than one they created themselves (represented by a circle of rope on the
ground), or advance within 5 feet of someone casting [Ward:
Undead](#ward-undead) or [Ward: Enchanted Beings](#ward-enchanted-beings). This
family of spells does not give you the ability to ignore weapon restrictions,
nor can you be compelled to forcibly break them. If you have any questions about
this, ask the spellcaster when they cast the spell on you.

* [Animate Undead General](#animate-undead-general): if this spell is cast upon
  you when your PC is dead, your PC becomes an undead creature under the
  spellcaster's control. You may not refuse to have your PC turned into an
  undead, unless under certain magical effects (see [Protect the
  Soul](#protect-the-soul)). You are now playing a greater undead version of
  your PC and have access to all their spells, abilities, and knowledge. In
  addition your PC now has the ability to cast [Animate Lesser
  Undead](#animate-lesser-undead) with unlimited castings. The Undead General
  will die to any damaging magical attacks regardless of location. Your PC must
  follow the orders of the spellcaster. The spell ends if your PC is slain and
  raised or simply raised.
* [Animate Undead](#animate-undead): if this spell is cast upon you when your PC
  is dead, your PC becomes an undead creature under the spellcaster's control.
  You may not refuse to have your PC turned into an undead, unless under certain
  magical effects (see [Protect the Soul](#protect-the-soul)). You are now
  playing an undead version of your PC and have access to all their spells,
  abilities, and knowledge. Your PC must follow the orders of the spellcaster.
  The spell ends if your PC is slain and raised or simply raised.
* [Animate Lesser Undead](#animate-lesser-undead): if this spell is cast upon
  you when your character is dead, your character becomes an undead creature
  under the spellcaster's control. Lesser undead cannot use any armor or spells
  regardless of what they normally have. You may not refuse to have your PC
  turned into an undead, unless under certain magical effects (see [Protect the
  Soul](#protect-the-soul)). [Animate Lesser Undead](#animate-lesser-undead) can
  be used to raise an undead (see [Animate Undead](#animate-undead)), but
  returns the character to un-life, rather than life. Like [Animate
  Undead](#animate-undead), the spell ends when your PC is slain and raised or
  simply raised.
* [Walking Dead](#walking-dead): certain spells will make a PC's dead body walk
  without either returning them to life or fully animating them as undead. When
  a PC is under the effects of these spells, follow these guidelines:
  * Walk at a steady pace, do not run.
  * Keep any items on you that you would retain if picked up and dragged.
  * Move to the destination as directly as possible without taking an OOC unsafe
    path. If the only option is to move into an OOC unsafe situation, then the
    spell ends and the body falls to the ground.
  * If another character interferes with the body, such as by attacking them or
    physically stepping in their way to block them, the effect of the spell
    ends.
  * The PC cannot take any actions other than walking; no attacking, searching,
    picking up items, using magic items, or drinking potions.
  * The PC is considered to be Undead while the effect lasts. See the [Undead
    Caveat](#undead).
  * The main difference between various [Walking Dead](#walking-dead) spells is
    in where the PC must walk to.
    * [Beckon Corpse](#beckon-corpse): the PC will stand and walk to the
      spellcaster as long as they are chanting. If the PC is forced to stop, the
      spellcaster may have the option to regain their attention and resume
      chanting, at which point the PC will get back up and continue walking to
      the spellcaster.
    * [Zombie Walk](#zombie-walk): the PC will follow the spellcaster until the
      spellcaster either ends the spell, the spellcaster attacks someone, or
      they are attacked.

### Potions ### {#potions-bmeesk}

Potions are disposable magic items that anyone can use. Common forms that
potions can take include, but are not limited to something that must be consumed
or a scroll that must be read or ripped. In all cases the potion needs to be
administered by a living or animated character, and after it is used, cannot be
used again.

* [Potion of Acid](#potion-of-acid): if your PC is dead, and someone indicates
  they are using an acid potion on you, your PC takes 200 scalping blows. See
  [Strange Brew](#strange-brew) for details.
* [Potion of Repair Armor](#potion-of-repair-armor): it repairs a hit location
  of damaged armor in 15 seconds when applied to it.
* [Potion of Combat Raise Dead](#potion-of-combat-raise-dead): it raises a dead
  character when used.
* [Potion of Heal Limb](#potion-of-heal-limb): it heals all of a character's
  injured limbs when used.

### Blacksmith Spells ###

Certain spells repair damaged armor and broken items.

* [Repair Armor](#repair-armor): this will restore one hit location of
  non-magical armor that has been damaged. For example, the armor on one arm,
  the chest of a shirt of chainmail, head armor, etc.
* [Repair Item](#repair-item): this will restore non-magical armor, weapons, and 
  other items that have become damaged or destroyed. This spell has a VC, and it
  fixes the entire item. For example, all hit locations of someone's armor, a
  bow, a boulder-crushed weapon, a shield, etc.

### Other Spells and Things You Should Know ###

* [Create Poison](#create-poison): if you ingest food or drink that is poisoned
  through the use of this spell, you will be handed a scroll upon which is
  written the poison's effect. You must follow the scroll's instructions
  completely. It will either kill your PC, cause them to fall in love with
  someone, sleep deeply, or tell nothing but the truth. All effects other than
  death are short-lived. A player that ingests a love poison always has the
  option of allowing their PC to die if they are OOC uncomfortable with the
  situation.
* [Cure Disease](#cure-disease) or [Potion of Cure
  Disease](#potion-of-cure-disease): these spells cure a character of a disease
  (see [Disease](#disease) in the [Combat Calls](#combat-calls-section)
  section).
* [Immunity to Poison](#immunity-to-poison): this spell makes your PC immune to
  the very next poison or poison attack that would otherwise affect them. It
  works only once per use of the spell. Call "Immunity to Poison," when you use
  this spell's effect (see [Poison](#poison) in [Section 3.11: Combat
  Calls](#combat-calls-section)).
* [Light](#light): you may not take the light out of verbal communication range
  of the spellcaster.
* [Pas](#pas): this spell creates a temporary truce. If you accept the offered
  bribe you are magically bound to not attack the spellcaster for 60 seconds
  unless you are attacked.
* [Protect the Soul](#protect-the-soul): this spell will protect your PC from
  possession, [Animate Undead](#animate-undead), and the like.
* [Speak With Dead](#speak-with-dead): this spell will allow the spellcaster to
  ask a dead character a single question per casting. Your PC MUST answer
  truthfully or abstain, using the words, "Yes," "No," or "Abstain."

### Regional Magic ### {#regional-magic}

At any given event, the EH may wish or require that certain magical abilities be
available to the players. One of the ways they can accomplish this is through
Regional Magic. Regional Magic is usually an additional number of spells that
spellcasters can choose from. Spellcasters can only choose from this list if
they had filled at least one spell slot with a Regional Magic spell. Regional
Magic is learned and unlearned just like any other spell, and may be learned
from anyone who knows it at any circle.

At some events, the Regional Magic your PC will receive is based on which circle
spell slot you filled with the Regional Magic spell. At some events, all of the
Regional Magic spells are the same, no matter which circle slot you filled with
Regional Magic. Others are completely random. Some EHs may require you perform
certain actions before gaining the Regional Magic. The details of Regional Magic
are left entirely up to the EH. No Regional Magic spell will have a lingering
effect that lasts longer than the end of the event. One thing to keep in mind is
that while Regional Magic is more versatile, it is also more unreliable. An EH
may choose a different spell from the list, a new spell, or nothing.

## 6.2: Learning and Unlearning Spells ## {#learning-and-unlearning-spells}

### Choosing Spells ###

The first step in choosing spells is to decide which 1st circle spell you want
to learn. Each path of magic is a list of spells of 5 increasing circles. 

A spellcaster may choose one of four options for each circle of a path:

* Any of the spells listed for that circle.
* Any spell of a lower circle.
* A Regional Magic spell.
* Alchemy

When a spellcaster learns their first path of magic, they learn one spell from
each of 1st through 5th circles, in order. If they learn a second path, they
learn one spell from each of 2nd through 6th circles, possibly learning some
spells for a second time. If they learn a third path, they again learn one spell
from each of 1st through 5th circles.

### Learning Progessions ###

At every event a character attends, they have the possibility of learning one or
more spells. If they do not learn a spell at that event, for whatever reason,
the opportunity is wasted and they may try again at the next event.

### Learning a Spell ###

There are three ways to learn a spell. You should find a PC who knows the spell
and learn it from them. The PC who is teaching the spell must have the spell in
their spellbook, must be able to cast the spell at that event, and they must
sign the book with their character's name. If you cannot, or decide that you do
not want to learn it from a character who knows it, you can ask the EH to
provide you with a quest to learn a single spell. This quest will add a single
signature toward learning the spell. Additionally, you may teach yourself a
single spell if it is listed in your Spell Mastery section. Your PC does not
officially learn the spell until your teacher, teachers, or MM sign your
spellbook legibly. Your teacher or teachers are responsible for making sure you
understand all of the rules that go with the spell, and may refuse to sign if
you seem unable or unwilling to understand the rules. This is important, as the
teacher may be held liable for their student if they did not teach them the
spell properly.

You may learn as many spells as you are able to prove understanding for;
however, at any event, for each additional spell after the first an additional
teacher's signature is required. Your first spell requires one teacher's
signature, your second spell requires two teachers' signatures, your third spell
requires three teachers' signatures, etc. You must actually attend that event
and play that PC. Teaching yourself from Spell Mastery counts as a single
teacher's signature. A teacher or quest giver may only sign off on one spell per
player per event.

### Unlearning Spells ###

Any number of spells may be unlearned at check-in of an event. You may not learn
a spell at an event where you are unlearning any spells. If you unlearn all the
spells in a path, then you no longer have that path, and your restriction
immediately changes to match your current number of paths. When you have learned
2 paths, you may not unlearn your first path unless you are also unlearning the
second path completely. Likewise when you have learned 3 paths you may not
unlearn both paths of magic that include circles 1-5; you may only unlearn one
of those paths unless you are also unlearning all of your path that includes
circles 2-6. Upon unlearning all your spells, you are no longer considered a
spellcaster. Any given spell may not change the path it is in without being
unlearned from its original path and relearned in the new path.

For example, Ethan is a 2 path with some healing magic in his second path. He
decides that he doesn't like healing very much, and he misses using a 4'6"
weapon. At the next event he attends, he unlearns all of the spells in his
second path, and he begins the event at Light restriction.

Fiona is a 3 path, but wants to change her 6th circle spell. The next event she
attends, she unlearns her 6th circle spell, remaining under a Severe restriction
but without access to a 6th circle spell for the event. At the next event she
can learn a new 6th circle spell.

Gunthar wants to become a fighter after being an spellcaster for many years, but
he doesn't want to give up the option of learning spells again later that year.
At the beginning of the next event he attends, he unlearns all of his spells and
starts as a fighter.

### Alchemy ### {#alchemy}

A spellcaster may choose to take Alchemy in a spell slot instead of learning a
spell. This still requires someone to teach and sign off their spellbook. Any
spellcaster that knows Alchemy must include a points total on their spell list
page. Whenever a spellcaster learns Alchemy they receive points equal the chart
listed below. For example, if Samuel learns Alchemy in his third and fifth
circle slot, he will have 12 points with which to make potions. All spellcasters
know three basic potions, listed below, and can learn more with the Strange Brew
spell. All Potions are governed by the Enchanted Item and Potions Caveat.

+-----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Spell Circle    | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
+-----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Points Gained   | 1  | 2  | 4  | 6  | 8  | 10 |
+-----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Basic Potions

* [Potion of Repair Armor]{#potion-of-repair-armor} (1 Point): Repairs one hit
  location of armor. The potion is poured or applied to the damaged armor and
  held there for a 15-second count. The armor does not need to be removed for
  the potion to be applied to it.
* [Potion of Mending]{#potion-of-mending} (2 Points): Recipient receives a basic
  regeneration. This potion will have no effect on a living target.
* [Power Potion]{#power-potion} (Special): Resets a single spell of the
  recipient equal to half of the points spent to create it, rounded down. This
  cannot be used to reset a 6th circle spell. (Example: a caster may spend 10
  points to make a potion to reset a 5th circle spell.)

## 6.3: The Basics of a Spell ## {#the-basics-of-a-spell}

### Spell Components ###

Spells have components that are necessary in order to cast the spells. Some are
specific, and every player must use the same component to make sure that
everyone understands what spell your PC is casting. Some are left open and the
spellcaster can choose any component that fits the description. The spell
descriptions list the minimal spell components required for each spell. The game
does not limit the spellcaster's freedom to define their own magic, so the
required components are as succinct as possible. You may add more requirements
for shtick if you like, but you cannot leave out any of the minimums.

Here are the definitions of the different types of components:

* Verbal Component (VC): These are the words you have to say while casting the
  spell. It is important that you enunciate your verbal component and say it
  loud enough so the person or persons affected can understand what you are
  saying. The verbal usually explains what spell you are casting. If the target
  cannot understand you, they are not affected by the spell. A verbal must be
  written within the spellbook in order to be used, and it must meet the
  criteria for the spell. Requirements such as "Talk to the EH" or "an
  explanation" can simply be written as such. Multiple verbals may be written
  for the same spell, and the caster may choose which to use at casting time.
  Verbals may be changed between events.
* Material Component (MC): There are three types of material components;
  required, disposable, and foci.
  * Required components are specific to a spell, such as bean-bags, foam, or
    duct tape blocks for the [Magic Missile](#magic-missile) spell. These
    components cannot vary from what is listed.
  * Disposable components are up to the player, but they must be something that
    is consumed or thrown away with every casting of the spell. A disposable
    component is something that the spellcaster could easily hand to the MM for
    inspection. 
  * A focus is a component that is not consumed or thrown away. Often, it is
    necessary for the spellcaster to brandish a focus while casting certain
    spells. The spellcaster may have a single focus for all of their focus-based
    spells. A focus is something that another player or NPC can obviously
    identify as the focus when the spellcaster is using it for a spell. A
    spellcaster must also be able to hand this to the MM for inspection. A focus
    may not be a weapon.

  All MCs must be specified and written down in the PC's spellbook for every
  spell that they know and, except for foci, the component must be different for
  each spell. A spellcaster must have at least one uninjured hand to use a MC.
* Active Component (AC): These are actions that the spellcaster must take in
  order to cast the spell and must be performed at the time of casting.
  Characters may add anything else for role-playing purposes.
* Duration: Unless otherwise noted in the spell description or caveat, all
  spells end when the event ends.

## 6.4: Caveats ## {#caveats}

Caveats are general rules that apply to all spells or spell effects of a similar
type. Each spell that is affected by a caveat is listed in the appropriate
place.

### Combat Calls ### {#combat-calls-caveat}

The spells that allow special combat calls are [Assassin's
Blade](#assassins-blade), [Armor-Piercing Weapon](#armor-piercing-weapon),
[Disease Weapon](#disease-weapon), [Enchant Weapon](#enchant-weapon), and
[Create Poison](#create-poison). These spells are mutually exclusive and cannot
be cast upon a weapon that already has a separate combat call. Weapon types,
such as axes or maces, are not covered by this caveat. None of these spells can
be cast upon a [Magic Missile](#magic-missile) or [Lightning
Bolt](#lightning-bolt-spell).

### Chanting ### {#chanting}

Some spells require that their VC be chanted continuously for the duration of
the spell. These spells do not take effect until the VC has been recited fully,
at least once. These spells last as long as the spellcaster continues the chant.
OOC explanations (such as combat calls) do not interrupt these spells. For
example, if a PC is chanting a [Transmute Self](#transmute-self) spell and is
hit by a weapon, they may call "No effect" without interrupting the spell; if a
PC is chanting a [Ward: Undead](#ward-undead) spell and a goblin hits their leg,
they can call "Leg" (or "Armor," or "Armored Cloak," etc.) without having the
spell end. The VC for these spells must be spoken clearly and loudly enough that
anyone affected by the spell can understand them. Chanting spells can be
disrupted by the 4th circle spell [Disrupt](#disrupt). It is the PC's
responsibility to know what the [Disrupt](#disrupt) spell is, how to recognize
it, and how to respond to it.

### Circles ### {#circles}

There are a number of spells that are considered circle spells. A circle spell
must be clearly defined by a length of rope that has been laid on the ground
with the ends overlapping. The ends cannot be tied together or secured in any
way, and the rope in general cannot be secured or bound in place or the spell
fails (see the [Spell Failure](#spell-failure) caveat). Only one spell may be
cast with a particular rope at a given time, although after the spell ends, a
different spell may be cast with that rope. The rope does not need to be laid
down in a circular pattern. Although a given circle spell may have a specific
way of being broken, all circle spells are broken if the rope is jostled enough
to move the ends apart by a character able to cross it. Any circle spell can be
suspended by the 4th circle spell [Disrupt](#disrupt). It is the PC's
responsibility to know what the [Disrupt](#disrupt) spell is, how to recognize
it, and how to respond to it.

### Compulsions ### {#compulsions}

Some spells are able to magically compel a character to act in a way the player
would prefer they did not. Compulsions can be ignored if they are humiliating or
exceedingly difficult commands such as "Kiss my feet" or "Move that wall ten
feet to the left." They also cannot violate OOC mundane laws or ethical codes.
They may not force a spellcaster to break their weapon restrictions.
Additionally, if the character has been turned undead, they cannot be compelled
to communicate knowledge gained before they were made undead.

### Enchanted Beings ### {#enchanted-beings}

All spellcasters, undead, and certain creatures are considered to be enchanted
beings. Normal fighters are only enchanted beings if under the effect of certain
spells, as per the [Undead Caveat](#undead-caveat). Enchanted beings are
affected by a certain number of spells, while non-enchanted beings are not.
These spells include [Circle of Protection](#circle-of-protection) and [Ward:
Enchanted Beings](#ward-enchanted-beings). By definition, any creature
considered undead is an enchanted being.

### Enchanted Items ### {#enchanted-items}

Some spells create or enchant items, or are enhancements that affect players.
These spells create magical effects, but are not potent enough for the items
bearer or the target of the enchantment to be considered an Enchanted Being, nor
is their magic potent enough for the item to be affected by the spell [Circle of
Protection](#circle-of-protection) once they are cast. If the MC of these spells
are disenchanted (through the spells [Disenchant](#disenchant) or the [Strange
Brew: Potion of Disenchant](#potion-of-disenchant) option) the spell will end,
rendering the MC inert. Magic items are not covered by the Enchanted Items
Caveat.

### Potions ### {#potions-caveat}

A spellcaster who learns [Alchemy](#alchemy) (not [Create
Poison](#create-poison)) must have a page in their spellbook listing the sigils
that they will use to label potions. Each type of potion they can make, except
for poisons, must have a unique, distinguishable sigil. When a potion that isn't
a poison is made, the spellcaster must put their legible signature, the
appropriate sigil, and the date upon the container. Once created, all potions
are considered stealable items. A potion can be a represented by a liquid,
lotion, elixir, magical food, or anything else, as long as it is safe to be
administered in a combat situation. Potions must be directly applied to the
recipient. They may not be thrown, dropped, or remotely applied in any manner.
The spellcaster need not be present in order to use their potions.

Potions take a 60 second process called Brewing to be cast. At the beginning of
an event, the spellcaster must describe in general terms their process of
brewing. An alchemist may brew as many potions as their spells allow during the
same 60 seconds. If they wish to create more later, they must begin the process
again. If the alchemist is interrupted while brewing, neither castings nor
Alchemy points are lost, but the potions will not be made, and they must start
over again in order to make any potions. Although not required, use of
additional props or role-playing is encouraged for this process.

No potion created by a player can carry over from one event to another; it
expires at the end of the event at which it is cast. The PC may choose whether
or not to further limit the lifespan of a potion when it is brewed by writing a
distinct expiration time among the required spell information on the container.
Any potions lacking a specified expiration time last until the end of the event.

### Regeneration ### {#regeneration-caveat}

Some spells grant the ability to regenerate. When this ability is triggered (by
death, being wounded, etc.), the target's wound(s) begin to heal. Until the
specified amount of time has passed, this grants no benefit. A blow to any kill
location on a dead body will cause a regeneration count to reset no matter where
the killing blow was inflicted. Impaling stops regeneration; the count resets
when the weapon is removed. Regenerating from death heals all healable wounds on
the body. If examined by another person, wounds can be seen to be regenerating.
Regeneration that brings a character back from death or scalping takes 120
seconds. If you are [diseased](#disease), it takes twice as long to regenerate.
You may only be under the effects of one basic regeneration and one advanced
regeneration at a time. If more than one source is causing you to regenerate,
you may choose which of those spells is causing you to regenerate. A
regeneration will only work on someone who is scalped if the spell directly
states that it can.

### Basic Regeneration ### {#basic-regeneration}

A basic regeneration is a regeneration from death where the regeneration begins
when the target dies (or upon casting the spell if the target is already dead.)
The effect is considered used if the target is raised before their regeneration
is complete.

### Advanced Regeneration ### {#advanced-regeneration}

An advanced regeneration is a regeneration from death or scalping which begins
when the character dies (or is scalped if it brings a character back from
scalping). Each time they die, the spellcaster may choose to double the length
of their regeneration (to 240 seconds, or 480 if diseased). The regeneration is
not considered used if the target is raised before their regeneration is
complete.

### Spell Sash ### {#spell-sash}

Some spells require a Spell Sash be worn to signify that a specific spell is
affecting the wearer. A Spell Sash may be constructed as a sash, a tabard, or a
belt favor. A Spell Sash must have the name of the spell clearly written on it.
Putting the Spell Sash on the target of the spell, or touching it if the target
is already wearing it, is considered to be an Active Component of the spell. A
Spell Sash is not stealable, and should stay on the target of the spell until
the spell is ended, at which time it is removed and returned to the caster at
the earliest convenient time. Either the caster or the target may choose to end
the spell by removing the Spell Sash, and it is also ended early if the Spell
Sash is disenchanted (see [Disenchant](#disenchant)). The Spell Sash must be
worn in such a way that another player standing 5 feet in front of them can
recognise it, and may not be covered unless the majority of their body is
covered, such as by wearing a concealing cloak.

### Spell Failure ### {#spell-failure}

Some spells have fail conditions in their description. Any spell that fails due
to its fail condition expends the casting of that spell.

### Suspension ### {#suspension}

While a spell is suspended, the spell has no effect and does not function until
the suspension ends. In addition, a suspended spell can be ended any way it
normally could. It is the spellcaster's responsibility to notify anyone else who
is affected by this (such as any players carrying potions that the spellcaster
created). When the suspension ends, any spell which has not already ended will
resume functioning as per normal.

### Undead ### {#undead}

Some spells will make a recipient undead. When the spell is cast, the
spellcaster must explain to the target what it means to be undead. All undead
are affected by the spells: [Circle of Protection](#circle-of-protection),
[Ward: Enchanted Beings](#ward-enchanted-beings), and [Ward:
Undead](#ward-undead). A PC will remember what happened to them while they were
undead. While undead the PC should have the spellcaster's best intentions in
mind. A PC may be raised as undead if they are [diseased](#disease), but this
does not cure them of the disease.

### Walking Dead ### {#walking-dead}

The spells [Beckon Corpse](#beckon-corpse) and [Zombie Walk](#zombie-walk)
enchant a corpse to walk without either returning them to life or being fully
animated as undead. A corpse under these effects must move at a walking pace
with their hands above their heads to their destination as dictated by the
spell.

They should keep any items on them that they would retain if dragged, whether or
not the items are stealable. If anyone directly interferes with their movement
or attacks them, they fall to the ground and the effect ends. The Walking Dead
cannot take any actions other than walking. They may not attack, search other
bodies, cast spells, pick up objects, use magic items, drink potions, or perform
any other action aside from movement. The effect does not stop regeneration or
other methods of returning to life or becoming fully animated from occurring.
Becoming alive or fully animated as undead ends the Walking Dead effect. Corpses
under these effects are considered to be undead (see the [Undead
Caveat](#undead)).

### Wards ### {#wards}

All Ward spells are also Chanting spells (see the [Chanting Caveat](#chanting)).
Ward spells affect a specific type of creature listed in the name of the Ward.
When active, a Ward spell keeps the spellcaster from being attacked by creatures
affected by that spell. A Ward spell affects creatures in front of the
spellcaster, limited by a 180 degree hemisphere extending from shoulder to
shoulder and outwards from the chest. The Ward will not keep the targeted
creature(s) from walking around the spellcaster to attack others nearby. If the
Ward affects them, the targeted creature(s) must stay approximately five feet
away from the spellcaster, but need not retreat if the spellcaster advances upon
them. To cast a Ward, the spellcaster must hold their spell focus out toward the
targeted creatures while repeating the verbal. The verbal should make it clear
what creatures are affected by the Ward. For example, "Stay back undead. Stay
back undead. Stay back undead. Shoo," would be an appropriate verbal for the
[Ward: Undead](#ward-undead) spell. This spell will work for as long as the
spellcaster holds out the focus and keeps repeating the verbal. The people
playing the targeted creatures must be able to hear what the spellcaster is
saying, so it is up to the spellcaster to clearly and loudly chant their verbal.
While casting this spell, the spellcaster may not attack the targeted creatures.
A being that looks like it should be a targeted creature may not be (or may be
immune to the Ward). It is still the responsibility of the spellcaster to take
any and all weapon blows that hit them, even if the blows are from a creature
they believe should be affected by the Ward.

### Weapon Calls ### {#weapon-calls}

Each Weapon Call spell has a VC or AC which prepares the weapon with the special
combat call, using a casting of the spell. The casting is spent if the blow
lands an attack to a legal hit location. Otherwise, upon a parry or a miss, only
the preparation is lost and the use remains. If you are unsure that the blow
landed, you must assume that it did. The spellcaster cannot cast a different
Weapon Call spell on a currently enchanted weapon until the first spell has been
discharged. The spellcaster's weapon may not be used by anyone else and still
retain the enchanted status. If someone other than the spellcaster swings the
prepared weapon, the preparation is lost, and must be reapplied.

## 6.5: Grandfathering ## {#grandfathering}

For the 2018 year only, all characters who were in existence (first attended an
event) before February 25th, 2018 are allowed to have up to 15 spells, making a
legal build following the rules of the current Omnibus. At the first event that
their PC attends in the 2018 season where the Omnibus is available, they must
get their spellbook checked in and signed by the Event Holder or their
designated Magic Marshal(s). This signature counts for the signature
requirements for all spells the PC grandfathers at this event.

All spells known after grandfathering may be added to the spellcaster's “Spell
Mastery” section, in addition to the list they had before grandfathering (if
any).

### Spell Descriptions ### {#spell-descriptions}

[__Animal Companion__ (4th Circle)]{#animal-companion}

__Uses:__ 1, and the spellcaster may only have one in-play - __Material:__ A
stuffed or toy animal that must be at least 4" tall - __Caveats:__
[Suspension](#suspension)

The spellcaster has an animal companion represented by a specific stuffed or toy
animal. The animal companion cannot be slain or disenchanted, but can be stolen.
The stuffed animal must be labeled with the spellcaster's name and the words
"[Event-Stealable](#event-stealable)." The animal companion grants two separate
abilities. The first ability is that the spellcaster may send their animal
companion to gather information once per learning of the spell. The information
gathered can only be relayed in a short sentence or concept, such as "the way
ahead is blocked," or "there are many foes," etc. This ability is represented by
the spellcaster giving their animal companion to the EH or MM and asking them a
question. If the spellcaster asks for information that their animal companion is
unable to obtain, they receive no answer.

The second ability that the animal companion grants is the ability to cast a
single spell up to third circle, except the spell [Implement](#implement), which
cannot be chosen. This spell will function as if it were learned normally, with
the same requirements, limitations, number of castings, and components. While
the animal companion is out gathering information the spells provided from the
secondary ability are suspended.

Any additional spells provided by the animal companion require the animal
companion to cast and maintain, as if the animal companion were a spell focus.
Each spell must meet the requirement for verbal, material and active components.
Spells with lasting effects (protections, immunities, etc.) can only be cast
upon the spellcaster. Any blow that strikes the animal companion must be taken
as if the animal companion is not there.

When the spellcaster first learns this spell, they choose their animal
companion's abilities. These abilities are not alterable from event to event.
The spellcaster must list in their spellbook every spell their animal companion
grants them as if they have learned the spell.

If they learn the spell additional times, the animal companion gets stronger.
They may alter the abilities of their animal companion upon completion of each
learning by giving it an additional spell and question. If the spellcaster
unlearns a use of the spell, the animal companion becomes weaker and must be
adjusted accordingly.

[__Animate Lesser Undead__ (3rd Circle)]{#animate-lesser-undead}

__Uses:__ 3 - __Verbal:__ 30 words, and an explanation - __Material:__ A tabard,
or sash which clearly states "Undead," "Skeleton," "Ghost" or the like, or an
appropriate mask - __Caveats:__ [Compulsion](#compulsion), [Undead](#undead)

This spell creates a generic undead creature that will follow commands given by
the spellcaster. It will only work on players; if cast on NPCs, they can refuse.
If an NPC refuses a casting of the spell, the casting is not spent. To cast it,
the spellcaster must get a corpse and recite the verbal while putting the sash
or tabard over the corpse's head, tabard-style, or while giving the corpse a
mask to wear. If there is already an appropriate MC on the person, you may
simply touch the recipient of the spell. The Lesser Undead is held at bay by
[Ward: Undead](#ward-undead) or [Ward: Enchanted
Beings](#ward-enchanted-beings), cannot cross a [Circle of
Protection](#circle-of-protection), and is killed in the normal fashion (no
special protections are gained). It takes all blows and is killed in the normal
fashion. It cannot use any armor or spells regardless of what the PC normally
has. It will obey simple commands exactly, but will rebel if given any commands
that violate the compulsion caveat. If left unattended, it will try to find the
spellcaster that created it. If the target is not raised by the end of the
event, they are considered dead and scalped. A character that is created as
undead can be slain and raised or simply raised while undead to return to life.

[__Animate Undead__ (4th Circle)]{#animate-undead}

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words, and an explanation - Material: A tabard, or sash which clearly states "Undead," "Skeleton," "Ghost" or the like, or an appropriate mask - Caveats: Compulsion, Undead


This spell, when cast upon a dead body, creates an undead creature that can use any spells or weapons that the target could normally. The undead is obviously not quite human, so it must either be made up to look a little odd, wear a mask, or wear a sash that clearly states that the person is some kind of undead creature. If this is already done you may simply touch the recipient of the spell as you say the verbal. What kind of creature is left up to the spellcaster, but it must definitely look slightly non-human. It does not allow a spellcaster to break their weapon restrictions. The undead must obey most direct commands given by the spellcaster, but is otherwise in full possession of their faculties. The only commands that an undead creature can ignore are ones that violate the compulsion caveat.


They are held at bay by Ward: Undead or Ward: Enchanted Beings, cannot cross a Circle of Protection, and are killed in the normal fashion (no special protections are gained). The target is considered to be undead until they are raised in a normal fashion. If Animate Lesser Undead is cast upon the target while the target is still undead, it will raise the target as if another Animate Undead spell were cast upon it, but the target's loyalties transfer to the person who cast Animate Lesser Undead (no additional MC is needed). If a PC is still undead at the end of the event, that PC is considered dead and scalped. This spell will not work on a body without its scalp. A character that is created as undead can be slain and raised or simply raised while undead to return to life.


[__Animate Undead General__ (5th Circle)]{#animate-undead-general}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 40 words, and an explanation - Material: A tabard, or sash which clearly states "Undead," "Skeleton," "Ghost" or the like, or an appropriate mask, a written explanation of what this spell does, and you must supply them with 3 MCs for the Animate Lesser Undead spells they will cast. - Caveats: Compulsion, Undead


This spell, when cast upon a dead body, creates a greater undead creature that can use any spells or weapons that the target could normally. The undead is obviously not quite human, so it must either be made up to look a little odd, wear a mask, or wear a sash that clearly states that the person is some kind of undead creature. If this is already done you may simply touch the recipient of the spell as you say the verbal. What kind of creature is left up to the spellcaster, but it must definitely look slightly non-human. It does not allow a spellcaster to break their weapon restrictions. The undead must obey most direct commands given by the spellcaster, but is otherwise in full possession of their faculties. The only commands that an undead creature can ignore are ones that violate the compulsion caveat.


The Undead General is held at bay by Ward: Undead or Ward: Enchanted Beings, cannot cross a Circle of Protection, and is killed in the normal fashion (no special protections are gained). The Undead General is considered to be undead until they are raised in a normal fashion. If Animate Lesser Undead is cast upon the target while the target is still undead, it will raise the target as if another Animate Undead General spell were cast upon it, but the target's loyalties transfer to the person who cast Animate Lesser Undead (an MC is needed). The Undead General will die to any magical attacks that damage it, regardless of location. If a PC is still undead at the end of the event, that PC is considered dead and scalped. This spell will not work on a body without its scalp. A character that is created as undead can be slain and raised or simply raised while undead to return to life. If a character under the effects of Embrace Death has this cast on them, it acts as the spell Animate Lesser Undead instead. You may have at most one undead general at a time.


In addition, the Undead General gains the ability to cast the spell Animate Lesser Undead with unlimited uses. An Undead General can only have 3 Lesser Undead at a time and must retrieve their MC before casting Animate Lesser Undead again. If the Undead General casts Animate Lesser Undead on anyone who is not under the effects of Embrace Death, they must use an MC.

[__Armor-Piercing Weapon__ (5th Circle)]{#armor-piercing-weapon}

Uses: 4 - Material: A cloth - Active: Wipe the entire length of the blade 5 times - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Weapon Calls


This spell gives the spellcaster the ability to enhance their weapon to pass through and destroy armor. After preparing the spell the spellcaster must call "Armor-Piercing" on the next swing of the weapon.

[__Armored Cloak__ (4th Circle)]{#armored-cloak}

Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 30 words - Material: A piece of garb with obvious runes or mystic symbols - Active: Lie on back while wearing the garment


This spell enchants a single piece of garb to provide one call of armor against an attack. It provides one point of armor against the next blow that lands upon the garment or any location at least 75% covered by the garment.


This Armored Cloak cannot be worn in combination with any other form of armor, ever. It can be worn while protected by a Protection from Missile or Resist Magic spell, in which case the wearer can choose to call either protection, saving the other for later. It can only be worn by the spellcaster, and cannot be cast on the same garment more than once. A specific piece of garb must be chosen for the MC at the beginning of the event, and cannot be changed during the course of the event without the EH's permission.


For each additional learning above the first, you may select another, separate garment to enchant to share the single point. For instance, if you have taken the spell twice, you may choose to enchant a cloak and a shirt, however it only absorbs one blow on either hit location (not both). All garments must meet the requirements of the spell, and are all charged through a single casting of the spell.

[__Assassin's Blade__ (6th Circle)]{#assassins-blade}

Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Material: A cloth, and either a single weapon up to 3' long or an arrow, labeled with "Assassin's Blade," "Event-Stealable," and the spellcaster's name - Active: Wipe the entire length of the blade 5 times - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Weapon Calls


This spell allows the spellcaster to prepare their MC with the spells Armor-Piercing Weapon, Enchant Weapon, or Create Poison, without expending a casting, although a use of the spell must still remain in order to prepare it. To prepare the weapon with one of the listed spells, they must wipe the blade of the weapon with the cloth 5 times. Only one spell may be prepared at a time onto the Assassin's Blade. Anyone may use the weapon, but only the spellcaster may utilize the special call with it. The weapon is one-handed, but may not be used in conjunction with another weapon or shield by the spellcaster. If the MC is IC broken, it will retain its magical properties if repaired.


In addition, any scalping blow dealt by an Assassin’s Blade counts as two blows dealt.

[__Aura of Protection__ (2nd Circle)]{#aura-of-protection}

Uses: Unlimited, one at a time per learning - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active:  Kneel or lie on back, no weapons in hand - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash


The recipient of this spell lessens the effect of the next hit they take from a call of “Magic,” “Silver,” “Disease,” “Armor-Piercing,” “Lightning Bolt,” or “Poison.” Rather than taking the effect they were hit with, the recipient of the spell takes the blow as a normal sword blow instead. It is necessary to call "Protection" when the spell activates.


When the spell is cast, the recipient of the spell must be kneeling or be lying on their back with no weapons in hand. This spell may be cast on a recipient other than the spellcaster; to do so the spellcaster must have no weapons in hand and touch the recipient while the spell is being cast. More than one casting of this spell may be in effect on a single PC. If the spellcaster casts this spell on another PC, they may not re-cast the spell until the sash is returned to them.

[__Beckon Corpse__ (3rd Circle)]{#beckon-corpse}

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words, repeated continuously, stating purpose of spell - Active: Spellcaster must be stationary until finished - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension, Undead, Walking Dead


This spell allows the spellcaster to summon a corpse to get up and move to them as the Walking Dead. The spellcaster must first get the attention of the player of said corpse and begin chanting the verbal. As long as the chanting continues, the corpse will get up and walk in the most direct (but OOC safe) path to the spellcaster as if under the effects of the spell Zombie Walk. If the corpse is interrupted, it will fall to the ground, but the spellcaster may finish the current round of the verbal, regain the corpse's attention, and resume chanting the verbal to renew the effect on the corpse. The spell will end if the corpse reaches the spellcaster, the spellcaster stops chanting to do something else, or they move from where they are standing (although they may be moving their arms).

[__Call the Soul__ (4th Circle){#call-the-soul}

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Five objects of equal size and shape, four of one color or design and one of a second color or design, and an opaque pouch or other way to keep them hidden - Active: A quest may be required


Allows the spellcaster to possibly find and reattach the soul of a scalped character. When cast, the spellcaster presents the pouch of objects to the scalped character, who must then reach in and take one without looking. If the object is one of the four, the soul is reattached. If the object is the second color or design, nothing happens.This spell must be cast in the presence of the MM, who may require an additional quest be completed.

[__Cantrip__ (3rd Circle)]{#cantrip}

Uses: 3


Allows the spellcaster to gain one casting of any First Circle spell, chosen at the time of casting. The spell gained must be cast following the rules for that spell, including VC, MC, and ACs. This spell cannot be used with Implement.

[__Circle of Healing__ (5th Circle)]{#circle-of-healing}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 25 words - Material: 10-foot rope - Active: Touch the rope - Caveats: Circles, Suspension


This spell allows the spellcaster to create a Circle of Healing. The spellcaster may name the circle with Cure Disease, Heal Limb, or Raise Dead, chosen at the time of casting. Until the Circle of Healing is broken, the spellcaster need only stand in the circle, touch the recipient of the healing spell, and recite the named spell’s VC to cast the spell. This does not use up any castings of the named healing spell, and can be done as many times as desired. No one but the spellcaster may use the Circle of Healing in this manner. This spell is broken if a weapon crosses the plane of the circle. For this purpose, a weapon is considered to be anything with a legal striking surface - therefore, swords and arrows are weapons, although bows and shields are not.

[__Circle of Protection__ (4th Circle)]{#circle-of-protection}

Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 10 words - Material: 15-foot white rope, or less - Caveats:  Circles, Suspension, Enchanted Beings


This spell creates a barrier that no enchanted being can physically pass, affect, or attack, with the exception of the spellcaster that cast it. In addition, no magic of any kind can pass through the barrier in either direction, again with the exception of the spellcaster that cast the spell. The spellcaster that cast the circle may pass over the barrier freely and may cast spells through the barrier at will.


A single spellcaster with multiple castings, or several different spellcasters, can combine Circle of Protection spells to make a larger one. If multiple spellcasters join their circles together, the result is a larger circle, but no enchanted being (even the spellcasters that created it) may pass in or out of the circle, and no magic of any kind (even from the spellcasters that created it) can pass through the barrier in either direction. Magic can be cast inside the circle as normal, but all the effects remain within the circle.

The spellcaster may decide to break their own circle whenever they choose by uncrossing the rope. The spellcaster can do this even if the circle was cast with other spellcasters.

[__Combat Raise Dead__ (4th Circle)]{#combat-raise-dead}

Uses: 3 - Verbal: 3 words - Active: Must touch recipient of spell


This spell will raise a dead character, healing all of their injured limbs. The VC must clearly state the effects of the spell. For example, "Rise and fight" is a VC that would make it clear that the individual is being raised.

[__Commune with Spirit__ (3rd Circle)]{#commune-with-spirit}

Uses: 1 - Active: Ritual - it is required that the spellcaster not actively seek out the MM or EH. The ritual must, in effect, be spectacular enough that the EH or MM comes of their own volition.


Allows the spellcaster to gain a boon of insight/wisdom from the EH. This spell allows the spellcaster to ask a spirit something relating to the plot of the event. How detailed the response or how lengthy the conversation is with the spirit, is determined completely by the spirit. It should be noted that the spirit does not have to answer the call of the spellcaster, and that sometimes instead of helping solve a problem, may give the spellcaster an awareness of more problems that need solving.

[__Create Poison__ (4th Circle)]{#create-poison}

Uses: 6 - Material: Disposable edible or drinkable component - Caveats: Potions, Enchanted Items, Combat Calls, Compulsion


This spell creates one dose of a specific kind of poison per use. There are only four types of poison created by this spell: Death, Love, Sleep, and Truth.

Death kills instantly.
Love makes the victim fall in love with the first person they see for the next 10 minutes.
Sleep causes the victim to fall into a deep sleep for 10 minutes. They cannot be woken before this time passes.
Truth causes the victim to be unable to speak anything except the truth for 10 minutes, but does not force them to talk.
The type of poison must be chosen when it is cast, and each individual effect listed in the spellcaster's spellbook. The poison must be ingested and cannot affect those who don't eat or drink it. This effect must be written legibly on a scroll. This scroll is to be given to the victim by the spellcaster or MM immediately after the MC has been consumed. Only one dose may be made per use, and only the first person to ingest part of the MC is affected by a spell. The spell is always rendered inert by Immunity to Poison. While the poison may have the intended effect to alter how someone may act, such as a love potion, it may in no way be used to compel any player to act in what they consider an immoral or unethical fashion. A person who ingests a love poison always has the option of allowing their PC to die if they are OOC uncomfortable with the situation. In any case, you should talk with the EH or MM if the use of any poison bothers you.


Alternatively the caster may expend a use of the spell to coat a weapon with deadly poison. The next time the caster swings the weapon they must call "Poison." To use this spell this way, the MC becomes a cloth, and the AC becomes wipe the length of the blade 5 times with the MC.

[__Cry of Life__ (6th Circle)]{#cry-of-life}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: "All in the sound of my voice, rise and fight."


This spell instantly raises all dead characters whose players hear the verbal. The spell affects all who hear it, including NPCs and characters fighting against the spellcaster.

[__Cure Disease__ (1st Circle)]{#cure-disease}

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Disposable


This spell will cure the recipient of all diseases that are currently affecting them. It will not provide protection from catching a disease after the spell is cast.

[__Death Watch__ (2nd Circle)]{#death-watch}

Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Active: Spellcaster must sit without weapons in-hand for 60 seconds before they are killed. Each time the spellcaster is killed, they need to re-cast the spell.


Enables the spellcaster to see and hear while they are dead. You may not speak or move while dead, except for addressing marshaling calls or OOC unsafe/uncomfortable situations. If the spellcaster is scalped, all memories acquired through the current casting of Death Watch are erased (i.e., all memories acquired from the time of your PC’s last death).

[__Death Wish__ (4th Circle)]{#death-wish}

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words, and an explanation - Material: A scroll containing the trigger phrase and command Caveats: Compulsion


This spell, when cast upon a dead body, implants a simple command into their mind. The spellcaster must give the target player the scroll after completing the verbal. The target should read the scroll and may refer to it at any time. However, the scroll and the information it contains are OOC, and are not known to the PC in any way. When the target character is alive, and hears the trigger phrase, they must perform the command to the best of their ability. The spell ends when the target successfully completes the command, or is slain trying. The target may ignore any commands that violate the compulsions caveat.


This spell will not work on a body without its scalp. The spell Protect the Soul negates all effects of this spell.

[__Deep Pockets__ (2nd Circle)]{#deep-pockets}

Uses: 3 - Material: A bag no larger than 6" by 12" by 3"


Each casting allows spellcaster to deny any stealable items that are completely within the MC to the next three characters that search the spellcaster, while that bag is on the spellcaster's body. If the spellcaster is not carrying any stealable items outside of the bag, they may answer, "Nothing." All other stealable items must be yielded to a search. Each additional learning of this spell allows the spellcaster an additional 6" by 12" by 3" volume of bag, either as a separate bag, or a larger bag. However, the spellcaster can only have one usage cast at a time. Each search denial is used up on all of the volumes simultaneously. One Deep Pockets bag may never contain another. No matter how many Deep Pockets castings are combined it does not combine the amount of people that need to search it; it only increases the size of the bag.

[__Detect Magic__ (1st Circle)]{#detect-magic}

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words


This spell allows the spellcaster to take any one item (not a living or dead creature) to the EH or MM to ask whether casting Identify upon the object will yield any information the spellcaster cannot determine by looking at it, such as "It's a stick," or "It's a sword."  It may be cast on a living or dead being to
detect a magical item it carries, such as a spell focus or magic weapon. In this case, it will not tell what the item does, only that it is there and which item it is.  If cast in this manner multiple times and there are multiple magical items, it will not repeat magic items until there are no new items to reveal.

[__Disease Weapon__ (3rd Circle)]{#disease-weapon}

Uses: 3 - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spellcaster's weapon - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Weapon Calls


This spell allows the spellcaster to temporarily enchant their weapon. After preparing it with the spell, it is considered a diseased weapon and the spellcaster must call "Disease" on the next swing of the weapon.

[__Disenchant__ (3rd Circle)]{#disenchant}

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Active: Touch the target item


This spell will remove enchantments from the target item. If the target item is a potion, panacea, or scroll, it will be rendered inert. If the target is a magic weapon it will no longer function as such until repaired by a Reforge spell. If the target is a Spell Sash, then the spell represented by the Sash is ended. Circle of Protection, Light, and other pure spells are not affected unless otherwise stated in their description. Only items specified by the EH are immune to this spell.

[__Disrupt__ (4th Circle)]{#disrupt}

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 30 words, starting with "I disrupt this (spell name) ..." - Active: Clearly point at the target - Caveats: Suspension


This spell will suspend any circle or chanting spell (see Circles and Chanting Caveats). It may only be cast upon a spell that is currently in use. Once the spellcaster completes the disruption, the target spell is suspended for five minutes and the spellcaster of the target spell loses the ability to cast the target spell for five minutes. If the target spell ends before the disruption is completed (the spellcaster stops chanting, the circle is broken, etc.), the spellcaster of that spell still loses the ability to cast that spell for five minutes. This spell only stops the current learning of the target spell. Therefore, if the spellcaster has taken Ward: Enchanted Beings twice, they temporarily lose the ability to cast one, but retain the ability to cast the other.

[__Disrupt Light__ (1st Circle)]{#disrupt-light}

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words, which must clearly state the effect of the spell


This spell cancels Light spells cast by other spellcasters. Once the Disrupt Light spellcaster is within sight and hearing of a Light spellcaster, they may loudly call out their verbal. Upon completion of the verbal, all other spellcasters within hearing range must put away their active Light spells. This action is OOC, and those affected must do so even if they hear the spell while dead. Spellcasters so affected cannot recast the Light spell for five minutes, after which time they may reuse the same chemical light sticks.

[__Divine Aid__ (4th Circle)]{#divine-aid}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: Speak to EH - Material: A sacrifice may be required - Active: A quest may be required


This spell allows the spellcaster to send a request for aid to a higher power. The request cannot be specific and the higher power may send whatever aid they see fit. This spell comes with no guarantee that the EH won't simply listen to the request and say "No." This spell cannot create an effect that will last beyond the end of the event, other than for healing purposes. A spellcaster who uses drama and theatrics has a better chance of success.

[__Embrace Death__ (6th Circle)]{#embrace-death}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 40 words - Material: A container at least 4 inches in diameter able to hold the spellcaster's scalp token. The container cannot be placed into Deep Pockets. - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Regeneration, Basic Regeneration, Undead


This spell allows the spellcaster to remove their soul from their body, giving them the ability to defy death. The spellcaster's scalp token is the only thing which may be stored in the MC (hereafter referred to as the phylactery). When the spell is learned, the spellcaster must scribe in their spellbook a description of exactly what the phylactery looks like. Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster places their scalp token within the phylactery, which becomes an event-stealable item for the duration of the spell and should be marked as such. The spellcaster may do whatever they want with the phylactery: place it in a mundane pocket, hide it, give it to someone, etc. However, the phylactery may not be put into Deep Pockets.


While under the effects of this spell, the spellcaster is undead (see the Undead Caveat) and is not affected by poisons, diseases, or the spells Call the Soul, Cry of Life, Heal Limb, Potion of Combat Raise Dead, Potion of Heal Limb, Regenerate the Scalp, Regeneration, and Seed of Life. Additionally, the spells Raise Dead and Combat Raise Dead will only affect the spellcaster if the character casting these spells is touching the phylactery. Being raised in this manner returns the spellcaster to undeath and repairs all of their damaged limbs.


While this spell is active, the spellcaster's limbs may be regenerated by remaining stationary for 30 seconds. The spells Animate Undead, Animate Undead General, and Animate Lesser Undead, as well as Potion of Animate Lesser Undead and Potion of Animate Undead from the spell Strange Brew, will return the spellcaster to undeath (repairing any damaged limbs), without placing the spellcaster into someone else's control. While in possession of the phylactery, the spellcaster may enchant themselves to regenerate (as described below) by sitting without weapons in hand and incanting the VC. This grants a basic regeneration that will return the spellcaster to undeath the next time they die. If the spellcaster is killed with magic, the regeneration time will double to 240 seconds. Once returned to undeath the spellcaster must re-enchant themselves as described above, before they will regenerate again in this manner.


Scalping will prevent the spellcaster from regenerating, but they may still be returned to undeath by any other means described previously. The spellcaster does not hand over their scalp token when scalped while under the effects of this spell.


The spellcaster may end this spell at any time by opening the phylactery, returning the soul to their body. If the phylactery is disenchanted (by use of the Disenchant spell or a Potion of Disenchant), the spell is forcibly ended, and the spellcaster is slain and considered scalped. If the spell is not ended before the end of the event, the spellcaster is considered dead and scalped.

[__Enchant Armor__ (4th Circle)]{#enchant-armor}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words and an explanation - Material: A non-stealable token with the spellcaster's name and the words "Enchant Armor" on it - Caveats: Enchanted Items


This spell enchants armor worn by one person that the spellcaster may continually repair without expending other spells. When the spellcaster enchants the armor they give the token to the person that will be wearing it. The person wearing the armor must have the token on themselves at all times while the spell is in effect. Once this spell is cast on armor that a character is wearing, it remains enchanted until the token is disenchanted or the spell ends. As long as the person with the armor has the token, and the armor is still enchanted, the spellcaster may cast Repair Armor as an unlimited effect on the armor by performing that spell's AC on the enchanted armor. This spell does not require the caster to currently have the spell Repair Armor or have any remaining castings of Repair Armor in order to use this effect.

[__Enchant Weapon__ (3rd Circle)]{#enchant-weapon}

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 10 words - Active: Hold the target weapon with both hands - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items


This spell gives the spellcaster the ability to temporarily enchant a weapon or bow. After preparing it with the spell, the weapon user must call “Magic” or “Silver” the next 3 times they swing that weapon or fire that bow. The caster chooses which option, Magic or Silver, upon casting the spell, and must inform the recipient which option they are imbuing it with. These calls are expended whether the user scores a successful hit or not.

[__Enfeeble Being__ (3rd Circle)]{#enfeeble-being}

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words, starting with "I declare you mundane ..."


This spell allows the spellcaster to remove the special powers and abilities from a single NPC creature. To cast the spell, the spellcaster must get the creature’s attention and begin the verbal. Once the spell is completed, the target loses all special powers and abilities. This includes natural armor, spells, regeneration, etc. Because this is a relatively low-circle spell, it will probably not affect more powerful creatures, such as unique enemies or the proverbial "Big Bad Guy," but it might work on things like a troll, a lesser demon, or a goblin shaman. This spell will never work on PCs. A spellcaster should choose their targets wisely.

[__Familiar__ (5th Circle)]{#familiar}

Uses: 1. The spellcaster may only have one in-play - Material: A stuffed or toy animal that must be at least 4" tall - Caveats: Suspension


The spellcaster has a familiar that grants them more spell potential, represented by a specific stuffed or toy animal. The familiar cannot be slain or disenchanted, but can be stolen. The stuffed animal must be labeled with the spellcaster's name and the words "Event-Stealable."


Any additional spells provided by the familiar require the presence of the familiar to cast it and maintain it, as if the familiar were a spell focus or additional MC. If the familiar is stolen or dropped, the spellcaster may not cast or maintain any of the extra spells. Each spell must meet the requirement for VC, MC, and ACs. Spells with lasting effects (protections, immunities, etc.) can only be cast upon the spellcaster. Spells with lasting effects are suspended while the familiar is not in the spellcaster's possession. Any blow that strikes the familiar must be taken as if the familiar is not there.


The spellcaster has 5 points to spend on extra spells for every casting of this spell, up to 15 points total.

The spellcaster must list every spell their familiar grants them in their spellbook as if they have learned the spell.

                                                                   

If they learn the spell Familiar a second (or third) time, they may alter the abilities of their familiar upon completion of each learning. If the spellcaster unlearns a use of the spell Familiar, the familiar they have then becomes weaker and must be adjusted accordingly.


[__Feign Death__ (3rd Circle)]{#feign-death}

Uses: Unlimited - Material: A cloth - Active: Wipe cloth over face 5 times


This spell allows the spellcaster to disguise themselves so as to appear dead. If someone asks them if they are dead they can legally answer "Yes," and may lie down or sit with their sword or arm above their head as to appear dead (see Section 3.4: Character Death and Section 3.5: Scalping). Feign Death ends once the spellcaster moves or speaks (except for addressing marshaling calls or OOC uncomfortable/unsafe situations). If a person moves them, thinking they are dead, the Feign Death does not end; only when they move themselves. If struck while using Feign Death, the spellcaster is still affected by the blow as normal.


[__Fighter's Intuition__ (1st Circle)]{#fighters-intuition}

Uses: 3 - Material: Spell Sash - Active: place sash on fighter - Caveats: Spell Sash


This spell must be cast on a non-spellcaster by placing the sash on the fighter and giving an explanation of how it works. This does not make the fighter an enchanted being.


This fighter may now call out “Fighter’s Intuition” once. When the fighter does this, they may or may not learn information about a monster they can see. It is up to the event staff to decide to provide this information or not. The information can be anything: weakness, methods of defeating, or even what the NPC likes to eat.

[__Find the Path__ (4th Circle)]{#find-the-path}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words - Caveats: Spell Failure


This spell provides the spellcaster a route to find, locate, or travel to a person, place or thing that they know by name. For instance, you can get a response from "Where is the body of King Joe?" but not from "Take me to the person who stole my sword." The results of this spell can come as a guide, a map, a set of directions, a divining rod, or any other mechanic that the EH or MM deems appropriate. Be aware that the answer may not always be the safest or shortest path. This spell will fail if an answer cannot be determined because of PC action.

[__Foretell__ (4th Circle)]{#foretell}

Uses: 1 - Verbal: A prediction that the EH/MM must be present for


Allows the spellcaster to make a prediction of an event to come, ie. "Sir Thomas will slay a dragon with a silver sword." If the event foretold comes to pass the EH/MM may grant a boon to the spellcaster or anyone involved in the prediction. The nature and power of this boon is up to the EH/MM. The greater the foretold event or more specific the prediction, the more powerful the resulting boon should be.

[__Fortune Tell__ (3rd Circle)]{#fortune-tell}

Uses: 2 - Material: Fortune-telling paraphernalia, such as runes or a tarot deck


This spell allows the spellcaster to ask a question of the EH or MM, which will be answered in a symbolic manner. How much information (if any) and the form in which it is given is at the discretion of the EH or MM. As this is a relatively low-circle spell, no proper names may be used in either the question or the answer for this spell. For example, while a spellcaster cannot ask "Who killed Sir Schlep?" they can ask, "Who killed this knight?" and the answer can be "Tarot Card: Jack of Wands" but not "Bad Bart." This spell can only be used to determine information that is plot-related. If the EH or MM does not know the answer because the question asked relates to PC actions, an answer will not be given but the spell is still used. If the spell is cast and an answer cannot be given because of any of the above limitations, the casting is still used up.

Ghost Blade (1st Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: A white ribbon with the words "Ghost Blade" on it - Caveats: Enchanted Items


This spell enchants a single weapon to no longer affect the casting of the spells Raise Dead or Regeneration or the breaking of Circle of Healing. Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster must tie the MC onto the enchanted weapon.

Group Healing (2nd Circle)

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 10 words - Material: 30' rope - Active: Touch the rope - Caveats: Circles


This spells allows the spellcaster to cast an enchanted circle. This circle allows certain spells cast into it to affect all the people within the circle. The Group Healing circle may be used to enhance the power of the following spells: Combat Raise Dead, Cure Disease, Immunity to Poison, Heal Limb, and Raise Dead. Multiple castings of Group Healing from the same or different spellcasters may be used at the same time, creating a bigger circle.


To enchant the Group Healing circle, lay the rope(s) in a circle on the ground with the ends touching. Then all the characters to be cast upon should be gathered into the circle. The spellcaster(s) must then recite the VC, which empowers the circle.


The next spell from the accepted list cast into this circle by any spellcaster affects all within as if it had been cast on each individually; in most cases any MC is only used once. The Immunity to Poison spell still requires the necessary components to cast for each character affected.

Guidance (2nd Circle)

Uses: 2 - Material: Divining paraphernalia to indicate a yes/no answer


This spell allows the spellcaster to ask the EH or MM a yes/no question. If the EH or MM does not know the answer because the question asked relates to PC actions, an answer may not be given but the spell is still used. An answer will be given in the form of “Yes” or “No” by the EH or MM. If the spell is cast and an answer cannot be given because of any of the above limitations, the casting is still used up.

Heal Limb (2nd Circle)

Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 20 words - Active: Spellcaster must be stationary, must touch the target limb


This spell allows the spellcaster to heal one damaged limb at a time. The spellcaster must recite the VC while touching the recipient's injured limb. The spellcaster cannot move their feet while casting this spell, although they may be moving their arms (e.g., parrying, so long as they don’t step backwards).

Heartiness (1st Circle)

Uses: Unlimited, one at a time


Having this spell makes the spellcaster harder to scalp. The next time the spellcaster is scalped it will take 200 extra blows to successfully scalp them. If scalped for only 200 blows, instead of the full 400 blows, the spellcaster must inform the scalper that "The job is not yet done." A spellcaster can only be under the effect of one Heartiness spell at a time. A use is considered to be over whenever the spellcaster receives at least 200 scalping blows, but is in effect until they are either fully scalped or raised.

Identify (1st Circle)

Uses: 3 - Verbal: 30 words


This spell allows the spellcaster to take any one item (not a living/dead creature) to the EH or MM to ask what it is and expect an answer. This spell can also determine what race an unknown creature is. If the spellcaster can successfully reach visual inspection range, recite the verbal, and the creature is not hostile, it must state what race it is. The response is not IC speech by the creature, and it can answer while dead.

Immunity to Poison (1st Circle)

Uses: 3 - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Disposable


This spell makes the recipient immune to the next dose of poison that would have otherwise affected their PC during the event. When damaged by the next poison attack, whether ingested or delivered by a poisoned weapon, call "Immunity to Poison!" Only one Immunity to Poison is used at a time. The recipient must take any mundane damage from a poisoned weapon regardless of whether they are protected from the actual poison. The recipient should be given the MC when the spell is cast, and they should dispose of it when the immunity has been used. More than one Immunity to Poison can be cast upon a recipient; the effect is stackable. The MC of the spell is not stealable or transferable after it is cast. This spell can also be cast as an antidote for any one poison that the recipient has been subjected to, but in this case it will not provide any further protection.


Implement (1st Circle)

Uses: Special - Material: Safe, non-weapon Staff (between 4' and 6' long, inclusive), Wand (between 12" and 18" long, inclusive), Orb (at least 4" in diameter), or Book (bound, minimum 1/2" x 4" x 7", cannot be the spellcaster's spell-book)


The spellcaster is able to create a staff, wand, orb, or book (hereafter called "implement") that enhances their own spells. Each time the spellcaster learns this spell, they gain 1 point into a pool from which they may purchase special abilities from the following choices below. A spellcaster may only have 5 points worth of implements per event. At the magic check-in of an event, the spellcaster may choose how the points in their pool are spent.


Unless otherwise stated, abilities gained that augment or alter spells require that the spellcaster already knows that spell, otherwise there is no effect. In order to use the gained ability, the spellcaster must be holding the implement in one hand.


The implement is a magical manifestation and cannot be broken. Any blow that strikes the implement must be taken as if the implement is not there. You can not actively parry with an implement.


An implement may be disenchanted causing any effects or castings to be lost until the implement is restored. If disenchanted it takes 200 seconds of holding the implement with both hands and nothing else to restore.


Gain one additional casting of one of the following spells for 1 point each: Find the Path, Fortune Tell, Guidance, Precognition, Skew Divination, Raise Dead, Deep Pockets, Enfeeble Being, Beckon Corpse, Disenchant, or Disrupt.


Gain the following abilities for 1 point each:

The AC for Armored Cloak is changed to "Kneel on one knee while holding their implement with both hands."
When using a Circle spell you may double the length of the rope. This may only be done once.
The AC for Death Watch is changed to “Spellcaster must kneel on one knee holding their Implement with both hands for 60 seconds before being killed.” The requirement for recasting the spell is also removed.
The spell Death Watch allows the caster to move their head while dead. They still may not speak, try to communicate, or move in any other way while dead.

Gain one additional casting of one of the following spells for 2 points each: Call the Soul, Group Healing, Resist Magic, Animate Undead, or Soul Bane.


Gain the following abilities for 2 points each:

The uses for Speak become unlimited.
Gain 1 point to spend on your familiar. This ability may not be taken more than once. When this augmentation is first used through Implement, you shall list an alternate build for the familiar. This alternate build can only be changed by learning or unlearning a use of Familiar. From now on, when you use your familiar and it is augmented by Implement, it uses that new build. If you are using the augmented build, and you do not have your implement on you, you may not use your Familiar abilities.

Gain one additional casting of one of the following spells for 3 points each: Vision or Séance.


Gain the following abilities for 3 points each:

Gain one use of Regeneration. You are not required to know the spell to use this ability.
Gain one use of Regeneration. Upon completion, the spellcaster will be raised as a free-willed undead. You are not required to know the spell to use this ability.
Gain one additional Magic Missile prop.
Intervention (6th Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: Speak to EH - Material: A sacrifice may be required - Active: A quest may be required


This spell allows the spellcaster to go to the EH and ask a boon from whatever powers their magic. It should be cast in the presence of the EH or MM. It is to be used to request favors such as: "Oh, please, great majestic god/Fire Spirit/Navel Lint, grant me a quest to search for the lost scalp of my overlord, Sir Biff of Bonehead Ridge." This spell comes with no guarantee that the EH won't simply listen to the request and say "No." This spell cannot create an effect that will last beyond the end of the event, other than for healing purposes. A spellcaster who uses drama and theatrics has a better chance of success, and simple, small requests are also more likely to be granted. Any requests that will unbalance the game will likely be either denied straight out, or assigned an unsolvable quest.

Light (1st Circle)

Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 3 syllables - Material: Chemical light stick and dark bag - Active: Snap and shake the stick


This spell creates light. The spellcaster may use as many light sticks as desired. They must also carry a bag large enough to hold all of the glow sticks they will use and thick enough to prevent any light from escaping. The bag is to be used if they are affected by a Disrupt Light spell. The spellcaster may not give a glow stick to anyone who is going to travel beyond easy speaking  distance. It is possible for this spell to be disrupted. It is the spellcaster's responsibility to know what the Disrupt Light spell is, how to recognize it, and how to respond to it. It is a first circle spell.

Lightning Bolt (6th Circle)

Uses: 1 prop, unlimited use - Verbal: “Lightning Bolt” - Material: 1 white boff arrow or javelin prop between 2'6" and 3'6" long - Caveats: Combat Calls


This spell allows the spellcaster to throw a stronger bolt of magic than Magic Missile. The MC for the spell is a golf tube, aqua tube, or T8 fluorescent light cover arrow or javelin prop made following the Weapon Construction rules for arrows and javelins with the following additions:

The prop must be primarily white.
The prop must be between 2'6" and 3'6" in length and cannot have an arrow nock. The prop is not subject to the spellcaster's weapon length restriction.
The prop must have the words "Lightning Bolt" and the spellcaster's name written visibly along the shaft.

The prop is a physical representation of the magic. After it comes to rest, it cannot be affected or moved by anyone other than the spellcaster, but it may still be seen or guarded by anybody. The prop counts as a hand-and-a-half weapon and must be thrown, not shot from a bow. The prop, including its shaft, strikes as an armor-piercing magic blow to anything it makes contact with, until it comes to rest. Once cast, it cannot be cast again until the spellcaster recovers the prop. The prop is not considered a weapon and does not cause Spell Failure, except while the spell is active (i.e. from when the prop is thrown until it comes to rest).

Magic Missile (4th Circle)

Uses: Unlimited, while spellcaster has MC handy - Verbal: "Magic Missile" - Material: 2 beanbags or foam & duct tape blocks, about 3" diameter - Caveats: Combat Calls


When thrown, this spell strikes whatever it hits as if it were a magic sword. It will damage every location it hits, until it comes to rest. The prop is a physical representation of the magic. After it comes to rest, it cannot be affected or moved by anyone other than the spellcaster, but it may still be seen or guarded by anybody. A magic missile MC can be thrown with one hand. When a MC is being thrown, the other hand may contain only a single magic missile MC or a single-handed weapon or shield, and does not count toward dual-wielding for the purposes of weapon restrictions. The prop is not considered a weapon and does not cause Spell Failure except while the spell is active (i.e. from when the prop is thrown until it comes to rest). The spellcaster may only throw their spell props, and may not pick up those thrown by another spellcaster.

Masterwork Hammer (6th Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 50 words - Material: A boff hammer up to 3' in length with "Event-Stealable," "Masterwork Hammer,” and the spellcaster’s name written on it - Active: Special - Caveats:  Enchanted Items


This spell creates a Masterwork Hammer which swings magic. The hammer may also be used to repair non-armor, non-magic items (bows, weapons, shields) in 30 seconds. The hammer may also repair all armor on a target player to 1 pt., using the hammer as the focus of the spell, in 30 seconds. While using the hammer to make any type of repair the spellcaster must remain stationary and should actively use the hammer to simulate repairing the target. If the hammer is broken the spellcaster may repair it by holding the item in both hands and reciting the verbal. Only the spellcaster may use any of the benefits of this spell.

Mystic Forge (4th Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 25 words - Material: 10-foot rope - Active: Touch the rope - Caveats: Circles, Suspension


This spell allows the spellcaster to create a Mystic Forge. The spellcaster may name the circle with Enchant Weapon or Repair Item, chosen at the time of casting. Until the Mystic Forge is broken, the spellcaster need only stand in the circle, touch the target item, and recite the named spell’s VC to cast the spell. This does not use up any castings of the named spell, and this can be done as many times as desired. No one but the spellcaster may use the Mystic Forge in this manner.

Pas (1st Circle)

Uses: 3 - Verbal: Pas, friend... - Material: Food, coin, or some offering - Active: Offer the MC to the target - Caveats: Compulsion


This spell creates an uneasy, temporary truce between the target and the PC. To cast this spell the spellcaster offers something of value to the target and says something along the lines of, "Pas, friend orc, and accept these shiny bits to let me pass unharmed." If the target accepts the offering, they are magically bound to not attack the spellcaster for 60 seconds unless the target is attacked. If the target is attacked or the spellcaster is slain this spell ends immediately. Protect the Soul will block the effects of this spell as will Resist Magic.

Precognition (3rd Circle)

Uses: 3 - Material: Divining paraphernalia (such as a crystal ball or mirror)


This spell allows the spellcaster to gain non-specified information about the plot from the EH or MM. How much information (if any) is at the discretion of the EH or MM. One casting of Precognition may be pre-registered and the results of this spell will be presented to the spellcaster at check-in for the event. If a precognition is not given at the beginning of the event, the casting is not used.

Prophecy (6th Circle)

Uses: 1 - Active: Ritual (Optional)


This spell allows the spellcaster to ask the EH or MM a question pertaining to the plot of the event. The EH or MM will give the spellcaster as complete an answer as they are willing. The method of delivering this knowledge is at the EH or MM's discretion. A spellcaster may use drama, theatrics, or sacrifice during the ritual to have a better chance of gaining information. After casting this spell, the EH or MM may choose to release additional information to the spellcaster at any time during the remainder of the event or until a spell reset.

Protect Item (1st Circle)

Uses: 3 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Ribbon tied onto the item protected. Remove the ribbon soon after the spell is expended/used to protect the item - Caveats: Enchanted Items


This spell allows a single non-armor item to be protected from the next attack that would normally damage it. For example, a protected sword struck by a boulder would not be destroyed, but the wielder would still suffer normal damage (e.g., death usually). The call for this spell is "Protect Item." A particular item may only have one casting of Protect Item on it at a time. This spell does not protect against Disenchant.

Protect the Soul (3rd Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words and an explanation - Material: Spell Sash - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash


This spell will protect the recipient from possession, Animate Undead, and the like. When targeted by any spell or effect against which Protect the Soul immunizes your PC, you must call "Protect the Soul!" The spell will last until the sash is disenchanted or removed by the spellcaster. The spell will not function if the recipient is scalped or their soul is not within their body for any other reason.

Protection from Boulder (1st Circle)

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Spell Sash - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash


The spellcaster is protected from the next "boulder" call that strikes them. This protection extends to all equipment they are carrying.

Protection from Missile (2nd Circle)
Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spell Sash - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash - Active: Kneel or lie on back, no weapons in hand

The recipient of this spell is protected from the next hit they take from an arrow, javelin, or Magic Missile spell. It is necessary to call "Protection" when the spell activates. This spell will also protect equipment (such as armor) that would otherwise be affected by the missile. 

When the spell is cast, the recipient of the spell must be kneeling or be lying on their back with no weapons in hand. This spell may be cast on a recipient other than the spellcaster; to do so the spellcaster must have no weapons in hand and touch the recipient while the spell is being cast. More than one casting of this spell may be in effect on a single PC. If the spellcaster casts this spell on another PC, they may not re-cast the spell until the sash is returned to them.

Purity to Disease (3rd Circle)

Uses: 1, Self-only - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active: Lie on back, no weapons in hand - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Spell Sash


Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster becomes completely immune to the effects of diseases.

Purity to Poison (3rd Circle)

Uses: 1, Self-only - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active: Lie on back, no weapons in hand - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Spell Sash


Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster becomes completely immune to the effects of poisons.

Raise Dead (3rd Circle)

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 30 words - Active: Spellcaster must be within 2 feet of corpse and there can be no weapons within 10 feet of the spellcaster - Caveats: Spell Failure


This spell will raise a dead character, healing all of their injured limbs. There can be no weapons within 10 feet of the spellcaster at any point while casting this spell, or the spell will fail to work. For this purpose, a weapon is considered to be anything with a legal striking surface - swords and arrows are weapons, although bows are not. The player of the character being raised must be present to represent the corpse. No proxy can be used for the corpse.

Reforge (5th Circle)

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Special - Active: Special


This spell allows the spellcaster to reforge an existing item, either improving it or repairing a magical item. The spellcaster may choose one of the following options when casting the spell. Each option has its own effects and requirements for casting the spell that must be met for the spell to be successfully cast.


Silver Weapon: this option will allow the spellcaster to create a permanent silver weapon. This option has an additional MC of the weapon’s weight in silver coins (plain aluminum roofing tins, aluminum "Coin of the Realm," etc.).The spellcaster must write the words "Silver" and "Stealable" on the blade of the weapon. The spellcaster should also write "Silvered by" and the spellcaster's name on the blade. All of the silver that is collected for the casting of this spell must be handed over to the EH. All silver weapons are stealable, and the spellcaster must explain to anyone having a weapon made silver that it will be stealable, and will be considered property of the Realms, to be passed back and forth within the game as a searchable item, for as long as it is silver. A silver weapon will lose the quality of being silver if the writing on the blade fades to the point of no longer being readable or if the weapon is OOC or IC broken (such as by a boulder). Players may not protect the writing in any way and may not rewrite it. A silvered weapon broken IC (i.e., by any means other than the fading of the writing or the physical destruction of the prop) can be repaired by an expenditure of this spell, without having to provide the necessary silver. Repairing a weapon in this way does not allow you to remake the prop or rewrite the word "Silver" on the weapon. Silver Weapon will not allow you to silver an existing magic item.


Reinforce Item: this option will allow the spellcaster to make a normal weapon or shield unbreakable for the duration of the event. This option has an additional MC of a ribbon with the words "Reinforce Item" attached to the target item. The reinforced item will not be broken by attacks that would normally damage them (e.g. a boulder hitting it) as long as the spell remains active. If disenchanted through the spell Disenchant, the ribbon must be removed and the effect will end, but the weapon will otherwise remain intact. This option may not be used on a magic item, silver weapon, or bows.


Restore Enchantment: this spell allows the spellcaster to restore a currently-backed Realms Magic Item that has been broken or disenchanted to working order. This option may have an additional AC of a required quest. Potions and other spell components are not subject to repair. If an item has been physically broken or made unsafe, then the item must be physically repaired or replaced with a near duplicate of the item. Note that patching or minor repairs may be acceptable instead of a full prop replacement depending on the situation. Upon informing the MM or EH of their intention to cast this spell, the EH or MM may either present to the spellcaster a quest for the completion of this spell or simply declare the item "repaired" at their discretion. The spell is wasted if the quest fails or if permission for a repair is outright denied.

Regenerate the Scalp (5th Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: An item similar to the spellcaster's scalp, with some sort of indication that it is their second scalp - Caveats: Regeneration, Advanced Regeneration


This spell grants an advanced regeneration which will return a character to life from scalping. After regenerating in this fashion, the material component becomes the spellcaster's new scalp token.

Regeneration (5th Circle)

Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Active: Spellcaster must sit on the ground with weapons a minimum of 10 feet away while casting this spell - Caveats: Regeneration, Advanced Regeneration, Spell Failure


This spell grants the spellcaster an advanced regeneration. If you have learned this spell twice, you may cast a Raise Dead to "recharge" one usage. These recharges cannot come from Circle of Healing, or any other raising effects other than the Raise Dead spell.

Repair Armor (1st Circle)

Uses: 5 - Material: Disposable or focus - Active: Hold armor and MC for 15 second count


This spell will repair one hit location of armor. The AC should simulate physically repairing the armor, such as tapping it with a focus, like a boff-hammer.

Repair Item (2nd Circle)

Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words - Active: Touch the target item with both hands


This spell repairs any one normal object. It cannot be cast upon an item with a special property, such as a magic item. It can be cast to repair a weapon, shield, bow, or armor. It will repair all pieces of armor worn by someone that can be legally called in one casting. The spellcaster may have nothing else in their hands while casting this spell.

Resist Death (6th Circle)

Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active: 
Kneel or lie on back, no weapons in hand. - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash


The spellcaster is protected from any damaging attack for 1 hit. The call for this is "Resist Death." The spellcaster can choose when to utilize this effect.

Resist Magic (5th Circle)

Uses: 3 - Verbal: 20 words


This spell prepares a burst of null-magic within the spellcaster. If the spellcaster so desires, they may ignore a single magical effect. This ability can be used at any time, whether the spellcaster is dead or not. A spellcaster may not be under the effect of more than one Resist Magic spell at the same time. When targeted by a spell or effect against which Resist Magic protects them and the spellcaster wishes to ignore the effect, they call "Resist Magic." This spell will allow the spellcaster to treat a blow from a magic weapon as if it were a normal weapon blow, ignore the effect of any spell when it is first cast, or cross the boundary of a Circle of Protection. The spell ends if the spell Disenchant is cast upon the spellcaster (although the spellcaster can use the Resist Magic to prevent the Disenchant from removing any other spells upon them). This spell cannot be cast on anyone other than the spellcaster and will only protect the spellcaster, not anything they have or possess.

Ritual of Banishment (6th Circle)

Uses: Special, see below - Verbal: 40 words in "burst" form, otherwise special, see below


This spell allows the spellcaster to use their knowledge of magic and the planes to shift a creature back to its home dimension or to scatter the magic of a being. The spellcaster has two ways of performing this ritual. If not given time to prepare a stronger ritual, the spellcaster may simply use this spell in a "burst" fashion. To do so, the spellcaster must get the attention of the creature and say the 40 words, which must begin with "I banish you to the place from which you came..." During the casting of the spell, the spellcaster is still open to any retaliation from the creature being banished.


If given more time, the spellcaster can craft a more potent spell to send a creature to its home plane or

 strip the being of magics, potentially weakening it in the process. The player may do so by performing a ritual in front of the MM or EH. By reading the available magic and essences of the creature, this ritual may grant the spellcaster knowledge and further steps that can be taken to banish or weaken the creature, possibly leading to the final incantation. After the initial casting of the ritual, this spell is unleashed when the spellcaster uses the researched magic upon the creature. The prepared spell may only be good for one attempt, whether successful or not. Greater success in crafting this magic may be achieved through knowledge of the True Name of the creature, a physical or magical part of it or through a particularly potent ritual.


Players who use drama and theatrics in their ritual are more likely of achieving better results. This spell will only function upon NPCs. Once this spell is attempted upon a creature, either in short or long formats, the spellcaster may not cast this spell again for an hour. You are encouraged to use a small timepiece to keep track of this time. Creatures that are shown to be too powerful from the preparation ritual do not weaken the spellcaster. You may not begin a preparation ritual on the same day as an uncompleted previous spell. Upon completion of a more in-depth ritual, the spellcaster should ask the EH or MM how long this spell is exhausted for, which may be the rest of the day. If you know this spell, you must inform the EH or MM at check-in.


Séance (4th Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 20 words to start - Material: 3-minute hourglass/timer.


This spell allows the spellcaster to have an extended discussion with a spirit, either one of another world or of a scalped character. Upon informing the EH or MM of their intent to cast this spell, the spellcaster must start the ritual by flipping the hourglass. If the spirit does not arrive within the first three minutes, then the casting is not used. If the spirit arrives, let the glass run out and flip it again. The spellcaster and spirit may then speak freely until all the sands have fallen. If the spirit stays longer than three minutes, the spellcaster may continue to converse with it. Please note that this spell does not change any behavior on the part of the spirit, and it may choose not to talk.


Whether a scalped character can answer is entirely up to the discretion of the EH or MM, who must be present for the ritual. This spell in no way grants the knowledge of the circumstances of a scalped character’s death. If they are allowed to be contacted, the scalped PC can still refuse to answer, is not compelled to speak, can lie or tell the truth freely, and can end the séance at any time. A PC contacted with a séance must leave after three minutes.

Second Chance (6th Circle)

Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: A token with the spellcaster's name


This spell allows the spellcaster to recover once, even from the most grievous of wounds and situations.

Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster must give their token to the MM. At any time afterwards, the spellcaster may activate the spell, which removes them from play. They must then go find the MM. All stealable items in possession of the spellcaster must be left behind. This spell may be activated even if the spellcaster is dead or scalped.


The MM will then place them somewhere on site (location determined by the MM) and return the token. Upon being placed, the spellcaster is alive and unwounded, and is given back their soul if they were scalped.

Seed of Life (6th Circle)

Uses: Unlimited, while spellcaster has MC handy - Verbal: 30 words and an explanation - Material: 1 token with the spellcaster's name and the words "Seed of Life" on it - Caveats: Regeneration, Basic Regeneration


When cast on a dead body, this spell grants the recipient a basic regeneration. The spellcaster must hand the MC to the recipient when the spell is cast. The spellcaster may choose to remain with the target, and as long as the spellcaster continuously recites the verbal (explanation not required) and keeps two hands touching the target, the target will regenerate in 60 seconds instead.  If the spellcaster stops the verbal or breaks contact the spell will continue as normal and the target will take the full 120 seconds to regenerate.


Once the spell ends, the recipient should return the MC to the spellcaster as soon as reasonably possible. Other than this, the MC is neither stealable nor transferable in any way. If the recipient is scalped, returned to life, or raised as undead, the spell ends. If the recipient is diseased, this spell will also cure them of their disease upon completion of the spell (although the regeneration time will still be doubled from the effects of the disease). This spell has no effect on the undead.

Shapeshifting (4th Circle)

Uses: 2 - Material: Makeup and/or mask and any disguise garb - Active: Change into disguise - Caveats:  Enchanted Items


This allows the spellcaster to shapeshift into a humanoid monster of about their height and size. This transformation takes as long to complete as it takes the player to change into the appropriate disguise outfit. The type and features of the monster are up to the player. Once the shapeshifting is complete, the player will respond to the spell Identify as the new type of monster. This spell will mimic a general monster type, and cannot accurately impersonate a named or unique monster, or appear to be another PC. You are free however, to attempt to convince your victims that you are more important than you actually are.


The shapeshifted form confers no combat benefit or other NPC power, though they can appear to wear armor or carry larger weapons to complete the disguise. You may in no way signal to NPCs that you are NPCing. The shapeshifted form ends if you are killed or if any part of your disguise is disenchanted (see Disenchant).


In addition, at the door of the event, the player is allowed to ask the EH or MM to borrow an appropriate mask for the event in order to complete the illusion. There is no guarantee that they will be able to provide the materials, so you should bring your own.


Skew Divination (3rd Circle)
Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Scroll with a name of an item, person, group, place, or situation - Active: Give scroll to MM


This spell will alter the next Guidance, Fortune Tell, Precognition, Find the Path, Foretell, Séance, Vision, or Prophecy spell cast about the target at that event, giving them misinformation. How much the spell is altered is up to the MM. To cast this spell the spellcaster must write the name of the target (item, person, group, place, or situation) on a scroll, sign the scroll, and give the scroll to the MM.

Soul Bane (3rd Circle)

Uses: 1 - Active: Scalp a dead body. Following the final scalping blow the spellcaster says "Soul Bane."


This spell alters the next Call the Soul cast on the target by reversing which object is successful and unsuccessful. The spellcaster must inform the MM who they scalped and cast Soul Bane on as soon possible. The effect triggers the next time the target's soul is called. The spell ends after the first Call the Soul, whether it was successful or not. Only one Soul Bane can be active on a person at a time.

Speak (1st Circle)

Uses: 2 - Verbal: "Speak, friend... " - Material: An offering for the creature to be spoken with - Active: The spellcaster approaches the creature with no weapons and with an offering in plain sight, and hands it to the monster


This spell allows the spellcaster to approach a creature and present an offering to them. If the offering is taken, the creature now has the ability to speak and understand the language of the spellcaster. This ability lasts until the creature is no longer in possession of the offering. No creature approached has to take the offering, nor is there any guarantee that the creature will speak to you.

Speak with Dead (1st Circle)

Uses: 10 - Verbal: An explanation, followed by a question - Caveats: Compulsion


This spell allows the spellcaster to ask a corpse one "yes or no" question. The corpse may only answer "Yes," "No," or "Abstain," and it may not lie. An abstention means that the spirit cannot or does not want to answer the question. Before asking the questions, the spellcaster must explain to the corpse's player what the acceptable responses are and that the character may not lie.

Strange Brew (1st Circle)

Uses: Special, see Alchemy - Caveats: Potions


You may create 2 additional types of potions listed below using Alchemy. Upon learning Strange Brew, you must write down the potions you are choosing to learn and their specific rules:


Potion of Acid (5 Points): Deals 200 blows to a body, only usable on non-living objects.
Potion of Combat Raise Dead (4 Points): Raises a dead character, healing all of their injured limbs.
Potion of Heal Limb (1 Point): Heals all damaged limbs of a living recipient
Potion of Cure Disease (1 Point): Cures the target of all disease.
Potion of Disenchant (3 Points): Disenchants an enchanted or magic item, as per the spell, Disenchant.
Potion of Soul Snare (5 Points): Recipient’s soul is returned to them as if the spell Call the Soul was successfully cast on them and their soul was called.The MM must be present for this potion to be used.
Potion of Animate Undead (5 Points): Animates a corpse as per the spell Animate Undead. The spellcaster must also provide the necessary material requirements of that spell for when the potion is administered. Treat the person who applies this potion as the controller of the undead.
Potion of Animate Lesser Undead (2 Points): Animates a corpse as per spell the Animate Lesser Undead. The spellcaster must also provide the necessary material requirements of that spell for when the potion is administered. Treat the person who applies this potion as the controller of the undead.

This does not grant any points to alchemy.

Transformation (6th Circle)

Uses: 2 - Material: A pair of Transformation Claws - Caveats: Regeneration, Advanced Regeneration, Suspension


The spellcaster releases their inner nature. The effect is a transformation.

Each individual spellcaster may have a different form, but that form is consistent to the spellcaster (i.e., Matt's altered form is different than Sally's, but Matt's altered form is always the same any time he shifts to it). The spell must be unlearned to alter that form.


A complete description of the altered form must be in the spell description. The spellcaster must alter their appearance when in the transformed state. They must wear a different tabard, makeup, prosthetics, mask, or some other major signifying indicator that they are "not quite right." Details should also be listed in the spellcaster's spellbook.


Any potions or other spells with a lingering effect cast by the spellcaster are suspended when they transform. The suspension ends when the spellcaster reverts to their common form.


All altered forms have the following advantages/disadvantages:

Has the use of florentine claws, 18" maximum. Cannot use any other weapons. Claws must be of matched length. Cannot use or manipulate anything except with those claws (after all, they're the end of their hands). These claws do not break the spellcaster's weapon length restriction.
The claws are physical representations for the spell, and are not really there until the spell is cast. They cannot be used by anyone other than the spellcaster, and they may only use them when under the effects of the spell. The claws must be clearly labeled with the phrase "Transformation Claws" and the spellcaster's name. The claws are not considered weapons for the purpose of Spell Failure. Furthermore, they are unbreakable and immune to the effect of a boulder, though the spellcaster is killed as normal if struck in the claws.
Cannot cast any spells while in altered form, except those granted as part of the Transformation.
The spellcaster may revert back to their common form, ending the spell at any time.

A spellcaster has 7 points to construct their altered form:


Armor Options:

Natural Armor: 1 point. Grants light armor on all hit locations. Can only be purchased once. Cannot be used in conjunction with Regenerating Armor.
Regenerating Armor: 3 points. Grants light armor on all hit locations, which can be regenerated. Can only be purchased once. To activate the regenerating effect, the spellcaster must lie on their back without attacking. Once so positioned, the spellcaster must remain still for 10 seconds per damaged hit location (repairing every hit location would take 70 seconds). If interrupted before all damaged hit locations are repaired, the effect fails with no armor points regenerated. Cannot be used in conjunction with Natural Armor.
Both armor options may be repaired by casting Repair Item.


Weapon Upgrades:

1 point for 2' claws.
2 points for 2'6" claws.
3 points for 3' claws.
4 points for 3'6" claws.
Poison Weapons: 4 points. The spellcaster may call "Poison" each time they swing their claws.
Armor-Piercing Weapons: 5 points. The spellcaster may call "Armor-Piercing" each time they swing their claws.
Axe, Hammer, or Mace claws: 1 point. The spellcaster may call "Axe," "Hammer," or "Mace" each time they swing their claws. The specific call must be chosen when the form is initially created. This option may only be taken once. The claws should reflect the nature of the call chosen.

Miscellaneous Abilities:

Limited Regeneration: 2 points for one use. All of the spellcaster's limbs regenerate after 30 seconds, as an unlimited effect. Cannot be in combat while healing limbs in this fashion. The spellcaster has a single advanced regeneration. 1 point for each additional extra life beyond the first.
Death Watch: 2 points. As per the spell.
Immunity to Poison: 1 point. May only cast on self, otherwise as per the spell.
Cure Disease: 1 point. May only cast on self, otherwise as per the spell.
Heartiness: 1 point. As per the spell.
Transmute Self (4th Circle)

Uses: 3 - Verbal: 10 word chant, repeated. The verbal must be chanted loudly and clearly - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension


This spell provides an immense amount of protection to the spellcaster, but also requires an immense amount of concentration. This spell only takes effect once the spellcaster has completed the VC once. While transmuted, the spellcaster is completely immune to all forms of damage, magical or otherwise, regardless of whether the material into which the spellcaster transmutes is vulnerable to any form of damage. It does not make the spellcaster invisible or undetectable. The spellcaster must choose what they are capable of attuning to when learning the spell. Choices are: trees, stone, or earth. To transmute, the spellcaster must embrace or lie down on the object they are capable of attuning to (so those who can attune to trees hug a tree, to stone lie on or hug a rock, or to earth lie on the ground). While transmuted, the spellcaster is "stuck" and cannot be dragged. The object the spellcaster attunes with MUST be at least as massive as the spellcaster. The spellcaster must keep their eyes closed and remain perfectly still, and they must be constantly chanting their verbal while transmuted. The spellcaster must chant loudly and clearly. If anything interrupts the spellcaster's concentration, the spell is broken. As soon as the spellcaster moves, opens their eyes, or stops chanting, the spell ends. The spellcaster may not transmute for at least one slow 200 second count after regaining their proper form. The spellcaster should use their common sense when deciding where to transmute. Pick a safe location, not the middle of a trail or a high combat area.

Vision (5th Circle)

Uses: 1


This spell allows the spellcaster to ask the EH or MM a question. The EH will then reveal to the spellcaster as complete a description as they are willing to give, giving them a vision relating to it.

Ward: Enchanted Beings (5th Circle)

Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 20 words, repeated continuously, stating purpose of spell - Material: Focus - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension, Wards


This spell prevents Enchanted Beings from attacking the spellcaster while it is active.

Ward: Undead (2nd Circle)

Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 10 words, repeated continuously, stating purpose of spell - Material: Focus - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension, Wards


This spell prevents Undead from attacking the spellcaster while it is active.

Zombie Walk (1st Circle)

Uses: Unlimited, 1 at a time - Verbal: 10 words, plus an explanation - Active: Touch the target - Caveats: Undead, Walking Dead


This spell allows the spellcaster to animate a corpse, making it follow them for as long as they concentrate on the spell. If the spellcaster engages in combat either by attacking or by being struck, the spell ends and the corpse falls to the ground. In order to cast this spell, the spellcaster must recite the verbal and give the player of the corpse a brief explanation of what they should do, making sure they know when to fall down.

# 7: Realms Administration # {#realms-administration}

## 7.1: Players' Meeting ## {#players-meeting}

Any player who has attended a legal Realms Event in the previous calendar year
can attend the Players' Meeting. The meeting is usually held several weeks
prior to the Event Holders' Council. This meeting is a forum for feedback on
rule proposals, rule changes, etc. Any player can propose a rule change to be
considered in this forum and the proposal will be voted upon. A player must
attend the Players' Meeting in person in order to submit late proposals
(i.e. proposals submitted the day of the Players' Meeting). If two-thirds
of those voting on a proposal support it, the proposal will be included as
an official proposal at the Event Holders' Council.

Proposals must include the name of the person submitting it and contact
information for that person. An email address is acceptable for this
purpose.                        

Those who attend the Players' Meeting shall be permitted to select one
representative (not an EH) to attend the Event Holders' Council. This
representative will have the same voting ability at the meeting as an EH, and
may accept amendments to player proposals submitted at the Players' Meeting.

## 7.2 Becoming A Realms Event-Holder ## {#becoming-a-realms-event-holder}

To attempt to become an Event Holder you must first throw an event with your
name listed as an Event Holder (see bullets below).

To be a Realms legal event, the following conditions must apply:

* It should be open to the public.
* It needs to have been advertised with full event information at least two
  weeks before the date of the event. Advertisement must include at least one
  of the following means: Publication in The *View from Valehaven* or
  *Creathorne Chronicles*, posted on the *RealmsNet* Event Calendar, or sent
  through a mass mailing or electronic mailing, which must include the known
  addresses of all Realms EHs who have held Realms events in the previous year.
* The location and the price of the event must be announced at least two weeks
  before the event is scheduled to take place. Any significant rule changes,
  especially those affecting normally legal powers and abilities of PCs, must
  be announced in the advertisement or mailing.
* The names of the EHs, at most one per day, must be announced at least 5 days
  before the event is scheduled to take place.
* A site must be confirmed before an event can be advertised as a legal Realms
  event.
* The event must be at least six hours long.
* At least 30 people (including marshals and NPCs) must attend and the EH must
  be able to prove attendance through signatures.
* Players must have the option of playing their normal PCs, within such bounds
  and restrictions as previously advertised by the EH. Players who do so,
  despite any such advertised rule changes which may adversely affect their PC,
  are presumed to freely accept such changes or restrictions.
* The rules must be based either on the current Omnibus to the Realms or on
  another rule system approved at the most recent Event Holders’ Council.
* If the EH(s) are under the age of 18, they must have an adult(s) either as a
  co-EH(s) or as a Listed Contact(s) in the event description. One of the said
  adults should be on-site for the event.
* An EH's PC may not benefit in any way from their event. Their PC may not take
  possession of any stealable item released at their event for more than one
  day. They may not receive spell credit as a result of attending their own
  event.
* In order for the event to be legal the event must abide by the valid rulings
  of the Arbitration Committee.

As an Event Holder you are expected to:

* Place the safety and welfare of players above all else.
* Show concern and caution towards sick and injured players.
* Be impartial, consistent, objective, and courteous when making decisions.
* Accept responsibility for your actions and decisions, as well as those of
  your staff.
* Respect the individuality of other players and event holders.
* Avoid any situations which may lead to or be construed as a conflict of
  interest.
* Always be respectful to other members of the community.
* Respect the land you are using, follow any site rule imposed by the land
  owner, and leave the site in better condition than you found it.
*  Keep up to date with the latest rules of the game and principles of their
  application.
* Refrain from any form of personal abuse or harassment towards players or
  other Event Holders.
* Respect the rights, dignity, and worth of all people involved in the game
  regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or cultural
  background.

Throwing a legal event gives an EH certain privileges and responsibilities
above and beyond a normal player.

* To validate your event you must confirm it electronically with the official
  Event List Administrator within one month of the date of the event. Also
  within that month, you must also send a summary of reports of rules
  violations and the conclusion of investigations into them, as well as all
  consequences levied, to the Arbitration Committee if any reports were filed.
  EHs and the AC have the responsibility to maintain the privacy of those
  involved in reports to the extent possible.
* If you release a Realms Magic Item at your event you must submit the name,
  physical description, and magical description to the Keeper of the List of
  Realms Magic Items within one month of that event. The actual prop for the
  item does not need to be distributed to players at that time, but an EH that
  does not designate a magic item for an event within one month forever loses
  the opportunity to release an item for the event (see
  [Section 7.4: Magic Item Rules](#magic-item-rules) below).
* As an EH you qualify to attend the Event Holders' Council meeting for the
  year following your event (see
  [Section 7.5: The Event-Holders' Council](#the-event-holders-council) below).

## 7.3: Arbitration Committee ## {#arbitration-committee}

The Arbitration Committee is a group of five members and two alternates
nominated and elected yearly at the EHC that seeks to resolve issues by
speaking or meeting with the affected individuals and, in the case where
actions are detrimental to the community, levy penalties against individuals.
The Arbitration Committee can be reached at <arbitration@lists.realmsnet.net>.

When individuals are found responsible for breaking rules by a simple majority
of the Arbitration Committee, the committee may levy punishment consistent
with both the charge and a goal of working to resolve the issue in the future.

At an emergency meeting of the EHC, a 2/3 vote of the council can overturn or
amend the actions of the Arbitration Committee.

The players elected to the 2018 Arbitration Committee are Angela Gray,
Ben Greene, Hannah Blood, John Berrini, and Keith Cronyn.

The two alternates elected to the 2018 Arbitration Committee are James Murphy
and Matt Butler.

## 7.4: Magic Item Rules ## {#magic-item-rules}

An EH is permitted to create one non-event specific magic item
(a “Realms Magic Item”) at each event for which they receive EH credit.
Only one magic item may be released for each event, even if there are multiple
EHs. Such magic items will retain their powers and abilities at all subsequent
events at which they are pre-registered/checked in, and approved. Magic items
are released on the date of the event the EH is creating them for and must be
submitted to the Keeper of the List of Realms Magic Items within one month of
that event.

If an EH has not held a legal event during a calendar year, any items that they
back are still considered backed for an additional calendar year. This means if
an EH decided to take a calendar year off from throwing an event they can throw
an event during the next calendar year and their items will retain their
backing. However, if an EH does not hold a legal event during that following
calendar year, any magic items that they released will be considered
effectively destroyed as of the EH Council immediately following that year.

All magic items must have the following written on them or on an accompanying
tag: the item’s name; the responsible EH’s name; the date it was released;
the labels “Magic” and “Stealable”.

Once a magic item is identified the owner should be handed a durable card(s)
with the item’s full description. In order to use the item a player must have
the corresponding cards on their person, or on site, for marshal reference.
These cards are considered part of the magic item, and when transfer of an item
occurs the cards go with it. Lost or damaged cards can be replaced only with
the backing EH's permission. If the card should become separated from the prop,
the card must be turned into the EH or MM. If a player leaves an event with a
magic item, and they don't have the card for that item, it is up to them to
contact the backing EH to get a new card.

## 7.5: The Event-Holder's Council ## {#the-event-holders-council}

Any EH who has thrown an event between January 1 and December 31 (inclusive) of
the previous year may attend the annual Event Holders' Council.

Although any EH may attend the meeting, there are certain criteria that you
must meet in order to vote there. You must have hit at least six events,
including your own, in the same year that you held your event. Additionally
only one EH per day of the event will be eligible to vote. For the purposes
of this rule, a day runs from sunrise that calendar day to sunrise the next
calendar day, and an event day must be at least six hours long. For example,
an event starting at 9:00 pm on Friday and ending more than six hours after
sunrise on Sunday may have three EHs.

If an EH cannot or does not attend their own event (due to real life
emergencies, extenuating circumstances, etc.), they may still attend the
EH meeting, but their eligibility to vote and back magic items will be
reviewed by the remaining members of the Event Holders' Council to determine
their eligibility on a case-by-case basis.

No proxies will be accepted at the Event Holders' Council. Voting at the
Event Holders’ Council will be by majority rule - a two-thirds majority of yes
over no, with abstentions not being counted, equals a majority. No guests
shall be permitted to attend the Event Holders’ Council. The Moderator,
Co-Moderator, and Secretary will be considered staff and not guests. Expert
witnesses may be allowed if necessary, with an appropriate vote.

Proposals that are supported by at least 10 EHs, who are legally able to
attend and vote at the Event Holders' Council, will bypass the need for
approval at the Players' Meeting. The proposal and indications of EH support
must be submitted to the organizer(s) of the Event Holders’ Council by the
EH-supported proposal submission deadline, which is one week prior to the
Players' Meeting. Supported proposals must also contain the exact wording to
be added, removed, or modified within the Omnibus, and include the section to
be modified. Proposals created or submitted after this deadline will need to
be approved at the Players' Meeting as detailed in the section above.

Note: A brief summary of the effects of the proposed change should ideally be
included as part of longer or more complex proposals; it is not a requirement,
but a simple bulleted list can help both players and EHs understand the impact
the proposal would have, reducing confusion and speeding up the meetings.

Each year at the Event Holders' Council several marshals are elected to help
streamline the administration involved with running the Realms. Below you will
find the titles, names, contact information, and a brief description of their
duties:

**Death Marshal:** Keith Cronyn (<Keith.Cronyn@gmail.com>, 603-819-8689). Tracks
and maintains ticks that are reported by EHs from their event for a character,
or reported by a character's player for their own character.

**Event List Administrator:** Ian Pushee (<bright@giantsquid.net>). Responsible
for maintaining an official list of events. The list is available online at
<http://www.realmsnet.net>.

**Keeper of the List of Realms Magic Items:** Neil Tozier (<iamtmib@gmail.com>,
603-689-5298) Responsible for maintaining an official list of Realms Magic
Items. The list is available to EHs online at <http://www.realmsnet.net>.

**Players' Meeting and Event Holders' Council Organizers:** John Berrini
(<SgtBerrini@gmail.com>, 603-398-6352) and Neil Tozier. Responsible for
organizing, announcing, and running both the Players' Meeting and the Event
Holders' Council for the following calendar year.

At the end of the Event Holders' Council, the EHs will discuss and vote on
whether to and how to grandfather spells based on the changes made to the
Omnibus.

Any serious issue(s) may be brought to the attention of the Event Holders'
List. If at least 50% of the EHs agree that a personal meeting is required to
discuss the issue(s), then an emergency EH meeting can be called. This meeting
must be attended by at least 50% of legal Event Holders. The person calling
for the meeting will work with the organizers of the upcoming Players' Meeting
and Event Holders' Council. Meetings of this nature will not have the ability
to make changes to the Omnibus.

An emergency EH meeting must be advertised with full event information at
least two weeks before the date of the intended meeting. Advertisement must
include at least one of the following:

* publication in The View from Valehaven or Creathorne Chronicles;
* posting on the RealmsNet Event Calendar;
* sent through a mass mailing or electronic mailing, which must include the
  known addresses of all Realms EHs who’ve held events in the previous year.

## 7.6: Challenging an Event ## {#challenging-an-event}

Questions on the validity of an event must be submitted to the organizer(s) of
the Event Holders' Council no later than one week prior to the Players'
Meeting. The organizer(s) are then responsible for requesting from the EH(s) a
list of players present at the event, and for attempting to contact at least
10 of them for a statement on if they felt the event met the legal
requirements or not, and why. This information must then be presented during
the administration section of the Event Holders' Council where all EHs present
will vote on the legality of the event.

If the EH Council finds that the event was not legal, any magic items issued
must be pulled, any ticks issued are removed, and the EH(s) who held the
event lose their Event Holder status for the year in question. The EHC may
impose additional sanctions, including suspension of Event Holding privileges,
as they see fit.

## 7.7: Omnibus Editorial Committee ## {#omnibus-editorial-committee}
Each year, the Event Holders' Council nominates and elects a five-person
Omnibus committee to format and maintain a master copy of the rulebook. During
the editing process, the committee has the power to make the following minor
changes to the rulebook:

* Spelling errors
* Grammar errors, such as punctuation, pluralization, etc.
* Spells mentioned that no longer exist in the Omnibus
* Spells that have had their names changed
* Text that was intended to be altered, added, or removed as part of a proposal
  voted in by the EHC, but was omitted from the proposal text and therefore
  creates an inconsistency within the Omnibus. These edits cannot
  substantially change the impact of the proposal
* Rearranging the orders of tables and lists, as long as these rearrangements
  don’t change how any rules work

Changes made to the document must be made by unanimous decision by the
committee, who must notify the Event Holders' List of changes not specifically
approved. All copies of the Omnibus produced for public use must be derived
from the master text, which is published on RealmsNET, although formatting and
printing process are at the discretion of the individual publisher. A digital
copy of the Omnibus text will be provided to any member of the community on
request.

Editorial changes as outlined above may continue to be made throughout the year
after the master text is published. The Omnibus Editorial Committee is
responsible for submitting changes to the Event Holders' List. If no
objections are made, the change is automatically accepted and the master text
will be updated. If any objections are made, the proposed change must be
submitted through the official proposal submission process outlined in the
Omnibus and voted upon at the following year's Event Holders' Council. The
Omnibus Editorial Committee must keep a log of all changes made, which must be
made available to the Event Holders upon request.

The Editorial Committee for the 2018 Omnibus is Becky Baron, John Berrini,
Patrick Bobell, Nicholas Contrino, and Pi Fisher.
