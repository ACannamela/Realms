<h2 id="what-is-the-realms">1.1: What is the Realms?</h2>
<p>The Realms is a medieval fantasy Live Action Role Playing (LARP) system (also known as The Realms of Wonder). This game has been in existence since the late 1980s. The Realms has evolved considerably since its inception through the participation and imagination of more people than can be credited. Unlike most LARPs today, the Realms has a skill-based combat system, and is community-based rather than run by a single, static council or corporation.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with what playing in a LARP entails, it is a lot like acting. The difference is that while the event staff sets the stage, the lines are all yours. You decide what “part” you want to play. Are you a mage, a warrior, a noble, or all of the above? Once you arrive at the event site you slip into your character. You stop acting like yourself and begin acting like your new persona. The Realms uses foam-padded “weapons” to simulate combat and has an intricate magic system to represent all sorts of things we wouldn’t be able to do in real life. The system is designed to help resolve situations that we cannot practically resolve on our own. Specifics of the Realms system will be discussed in more detail later on. You’re in the Realms now and you’ll never be quite the same again.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-book">1.2: What is This Book?</h2>
<p>The document you are reading is the official rulebook to the Realms. Covered here you will find what you need to know about combat, magic, and other aspects of playing the game.</p>
<p>Be sure to know the 2018 Omnibus rules, as well as any specific rules at each event you attend. At their events, an Event Holder (a player who volunteers to run an event, hereafter referred to as an EH) may choose to change some of the rules, including (among other things) announcing special weapon calls, defining special event-specific spells (Regional Magic), and allowing play-testing of new rules.</p>
<p>The game rules and the rulebook are updated once a year by a council of EHs in order to make the game more fun, make the game safer, clarify existing rules, and encourage increased, improved role-playing. For more information on events and the Realms, visit <a href="www.realmsnet.net">realmsnet.net</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-start-playing">1.3: How Do I Start Playing?</h2>
<p>First off, read this rulebook. Read the whole thing. It is also a good idea to re-read the Omnibus each year so you can be up-to-date on rules modifications and changes that occur during the Event-Holders Council.</p>
<p>Next, you will need to make a character (the role you play while at events). Characters are often referred to as Player Characters or PCs. This role will be the vehicle you experience the Realms through. Creating a character is old hat to many who have played tabletop role-playing games or other LARPs. If you are unfamiliar with creating a character or want some tips, see <a href="#character-creation">Part 5: Character Creation.</a></p>
<p>After creating a PC, the best way to become acquainted with the Realms is to simply go to an event. Most people will be happy to explain to you what’s going on. There is so much that can happen at an event that it is better experienced than explained. Attending practices is also helpful, as you not only become acquainted with the combat system, but also get introduced to other players.</p>
<h3 id="realms-events">Realms Events</h3>
<p>An event is where the game is played. There are basically three kinds of events in the Realms: Feasts, Tournaments, and Quests. Some events take on qualities of all the types, but are predominantly one of the three. Here is what to expect at each type:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Feasts</dt>
<dd>Feasts, as the name implies, revolve around food. Political posturing and court are often held at feast events. There is generally little combat at a feast event, and they are usually held indoors in the wintertime. Bardics, games of chance or skill, and other such activities can usually be found at feasts. Feasts are often a good starting point for some players, particularly those more interested in role-playing than in combat.
</dd>
<dt>Tournaments</dt>
<dd>Tournament events usually feature contests of both individual and team martial skill. These are usually held as yearly events, and are generally a social occasion. Players more interested in combat and less interested in role-playing and magic find tournament events the best starting point for their Realms careers.
</dd>
<dt>Quests</dt>
<dd>Quest events are the traditional style of event for saving damsels in distress, finding and killing evil demons, and many other tasks. Nearly anything can happen at a quest event.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="attending-an-event">1.4: Attending an Event</h2>
<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>
<p>A list of events can be found on realmsnet.net under the Realms Calendar or the Events tab. Whenever you plan on attending an event, you should register for it through realmsnet.net as some events may have caps on how many players can attend, while others may have different registration requirements or pre-event information to disperse to players who are planning on attending. Registering for events also helps give the event staff an idea of how many players they might expect, and helps them to plan accordingly. It is also important to register any dietary or medical restrictions you may have.</p>
<h3 id="check-in">Check In</h3>
<p>When you arrive at an event, there are a few things you must do before beginning play:</p>
<h3 id="event-fees">Event Fees</h3>
<p>You must pay any event fees; failure to do so means you will not be able participate in the event and may be asked to leave site. Some events will waive event fees for staff or NPCs (Non Player Characters) however, you must alway check with the event holder first. As event fees help pay for the site, props, prizes, food, and costuming that goes into throwing events, without them future events would not be able to occur.</p>
<h3 id="waivers">Waivers</h3>
<p>You may be required to sign a waiver. Waivers serve two purposes: protection for the EH(s) or the land owners from legal action, and to keep track of how many people attended an event. Monitoring event attendance is the way for the Event Holders’ Council to determine whether or not an event is legal (more on what makes a legal event in <a href="#realms-administration">Part 7: Realms Administration</a>).</p>
<h3 id="magic-items">Magic Items</h3>
<p>Magic items must be checked in with the EH or the event’s Magic Marshal (MM) before the start of the event. EHs and MMs must know about every magic item at an event, so that the event can be adjusted, if necessary. EHs and MMs have the right to fail or disallow any magic item at any time. Using a magic item at an event without first gaining approval by the EH or MM is cheating.</p>
<h3 id="magic-check-in">Magic</h3>
<p>Spellcasters must check their spellbook with the EH or the event’s MM to find out whether any of their spells work differently at the event before they cast any of their spells. Spellcasters with Regional Magic (see <a href="#regional-magic">Regional Magic</a>) also generally find out what their magic of the day is at check-in. Using spells at an event without first gaining approval by the EH or MM is cheating.</p>
<h3 id="weapon-inspection">Weapon Inspection</h3>
<p>Before beginning play, you must inspect your own weapons before they are used. If you are unsure of a weapon’s safety, ask a marshal to inspect it for you. EHs may require a designated marshal (referee) to inspect all weapons to make sure they are safe for use. There must always be someone at an event who can be asked to inspect weapons in case anyone does not feel comfortable inspecting their own weapons. If a weapon is deemed unsafe, it is to be removed from play or repaired.</p>
<h2 id="alcohol-policy">1.5: Alcohol Policy</h2>
<p>Alcohol is not permitted unless explicitly allowed by the Event Holder. An event advertised as damp or wet is informing attendants that alcohol is allowed in accordance with state and federal laws.</p>
<h1 id="core-rules">2: Core Rules</h1>
<h2 id="participant-rights">2.1: Participant Rights</h2>
<p>The Realms is committed to providing a space that feels as safe and inclusive as possible. Participants in the Realms have the out-of-character rights to personal safety and the expectation they will be treated with courtesy and respect by all other participants in the Realms. Participants have the right to bring concerns to a marshal or other responsible staff member with the expectation of having them investigated and appropriately addressed.</p>
<p>Every player has an obligation to read and follow the rules of the Omnibus. EHs understand that the game can be complex and the first step in dealing with behavioral issues or cheating in most instances involves ensuring that the player understands the rules.</p>
<p>However, if a rule is broken, or if there are repeated infractions, an EH may impose consequences on any participant(s) at their event. These may include a formal warning; removal from specific sections of an event; removal from an event; not being allowed to use specific weapons, spells, or items; or prosecution for violations of Federal and/or State law. If you are removed from an event for rules violations, the EH is not obligated to refund your event fee.</p>
<p>If an EH subjects a player to a consequence at their event they should notify all other EHs of this via the Event Holders’ List. The player involved must receive a copy of this notification and may send a formal response. People who want to bring formal charges should report such charges to the Arbitration Committee (<a href="mailto:arbitration@lists.realmsnet.net" class="email">arbitration@lists.realmsnet.net</a>). In addition, any participant that feels wrongful action was taken against them can bring the issue before the Arbitration Committee (see <a href="#arbitration-committee">Section 7.3</a>.</p>
<p>An EH may opt to not allow a player who has a history of breaking rules to attend their events, provided that player is notified in advance.</p>
<p>Event Holders have an obligation to take reports of rules violations at their events seriously. Having an additional person present during the reporting is strongly encouraged. If you report a violation to the EH of an event and are ignored or no reasonable action is taken, bring the situation to the attention of the Arbitration Committee. Event Holders who have a history of disregarding reports of rules violations, or who do not address especially serious reports may face penalties including, but not limited to, temporary loss of EH status, un-backing of that EH’s magic item(s), revocation of an event’s legal status, and/or being banned from holding future events.</p>
<p>Reports of rules violations to be submitted after the conclusion of an event should be submitted to the AC.</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">2.2: Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Anyone can report harassment or abuse. If someone’s behavior towards you has violated your rights as a participant, or if you witness the same happening to someone else, immediately report the incident to the EH.</p>
<p>If you have reason to believe rules regarding the Code of Conduct may be violated at an event, you should notify the Event Holder prior to the event occurring.</p>
<p>The following list is not meant to be exhaustive, and any non-consensual violations of a participant’s rights should be considered a violation of the rules.</p>
<p>Any of the following constitute grounds for punitive action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violating any federal, state, or local laws, facility rules, or event policies;</li>
<li>Failure to comply with the instructions of the Event Holder or designated marshal;</li>
<li>Using anything in an out-of-character threatening or destructive manner against person or property;</li>
<li>Endangering the safety of oneself or others;</li>
<li>Stealing (People’s tents, bags, packs, pouches, and possessions are completely off-limits and out-of-play. There are no exceptions, even if officially in-play items are concealed therein);</li>
<li>Drinking alcohol under the age of 21, or providing alcohol to those under age 21;</li>
<li>Physical or verbal intimidation or abuse;</li>
<li>Stalking;</li>
<li>Inappropriate physical contact or proximity. Any form of unwanted physical contact is strictly forbidden;</li>
<li>Non-consensual sexual acts (a person under the age of consent cannot consent to sexual acts);</li>
<li>Inappropriate sexual attention, whether verbal or physical, or continued attention after being asked to stop (sexual attention towards those legally or physically unable to consent is always inappropriate, this includes people under the age of consent);</li>
<li>Harassment for any reason, including out-of-game attributes such as race, weight, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or disability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Role-play can never be used as an excuse for any of these behaviors. If you are informed that your role-playing is OOC unsafe, threatening, or is not consented to by other participants you should stop immediately and find another way to play out the scene.</p>
<h2 id="the-safety-rules">2.3: The Safety Rules</h2>
<p>The safety rules are out-of-character (hereafter referred to as OOC). They are for our safety, and provide the guidelines that we should all be playing by.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-we-play-by">The Rules We Play By</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>We should all be doing this to have fun. If you get mad or uncontrolled, it is up to you to remove yourself from the game until you have regained your composure.</li>
<li>This is a sport of personal honor; treat it as such. You are responsible for keeping track of many aspects of this game, such as weapon blows and known spells. Failure to report or accurately respond to any of these aspects is cheating and a stain on your personal honor.</li>
<li>You must listen to the marshals at all times; they are the referees. If you are caught breaking the rules, a marshal may remove you from all or part of that event.</li>
<li>Report any safety concerns to a marshal immediately. If you have any questions, it is up to you to ask.</li>
<li>HOLD: If you see a harmful or unsafe situation (e.g., someone is about to run into a tree, gets their glasses knocked off, has had their weapon really broken in combat, is about to fall off a cliff, etc.) yell the word “Hold.” If someone is injured, it is the primary responsibility of the person who is hurt to call a Hold. Before calling a Hold for someone else in an otherwise safe situation, you must first ask if they are all right. Holds should only be called in the event of a dangerous situation, and should never be used to discuss the rules. If you hear the word “Hold,” stop immediately, then say “Hold” until everyone else has stopped moving. Once the emergency has been dealt with, a “Lay-On” (continue play) will be called either by a qualified marshal, or the person who originally called the Hold. Do not resume play until a Lay-On has been called.</li>
<li>Only weapons and shields that have been made following the construction guidelines (see <a href="#weapon-construction">Section 3.8: Weapon Construction</a>) are to be used. Weapons should be checked between combat situations to ensure continued safety. A qualified marshal may be requested to check the safety of any weapons or shields at any time. Any new designs or materials must be inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal before use.</li>
<li>There is to be NO real steel in any combat situation, or in any potential combat situation, at any time. Real steel is defined as metal knives, swords, axes, darts, spikes, spurs, etc. - anything that could really hurt a participant. Real steel that is sheathed is still a potential hazard.</li>
<li>Acts considered unlawful in the real world, such as theft of non-game items or assault, are also unlawful in the Realms. For the safety of all participants, any form of unwanted physical contact is strictly forbidden.</li>
<li>Any spell props, weapon props, or materials not specifically allowed within the Omnibus must be inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal before they are used.</li>
<li>While the wording of the game rules may occasionally be less than clear, players should not use any such confusion to their own advantage. A simple guideline is to not assume any benefits unless they are specifically granted by a rule. If you feel that the way a rule is written grants you an advantage by omission of a statement to the contrary, you must review that rule with a marshal or EH prior to utilizing that advantage. While this document has a lot of general rules (such as <a href="#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know">Section 6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone Should Know</a>), any specific rule will always override these general rules.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-rules-we-fight-by">The Rules We Fight By</h3>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>This is a lightest touch sport. ANY contact with a weapon to a body is to be taken as a hit. Ignoring a “light” blow is cheating and a marshal may remove you from the fight. There are to be NO full-strength swings. A marshal may remove you for excessive blow strength. Weapons, melee and missile, should be used with the minimum force necessary to score a successful hit.</li>
<li>The face (eyebrows to chin) and throat area are “off-target.” Do not aim for these areas. You may choose not to accept a blow that hits you solely in these areas, but you must call the location that was hit. For instance, if you are hit in the face, call “Face,” and keep fighting if you wish. This alerts both the other combatant and the marshal that you have taken an illegal blow. It is not unusual for shots to an off-target area to also strike legitimate areas in the same strike. You must take all legal blows, even if an off-target area was hit by the same strike. For example, a shot thrown at your head may hit your face if you pull back, but if it touches your forehead in the process, that is a legal blow.</li>
<li>In combat, there is to be contact with weapons only (e.g., weapons hitting weapons, weapons hitting bodies, and weapons hitting shields only). There is to be NO body contact of any kind (e.g., no shoving, punching, kicking, biting, grabbing, etc.). Do NOT grab an opponent’s weapons and/or shield.</li>
<li>Do NOT charge. Charging is defined as running at someone so that they have to get out of your way to avoid illegal contact.</li>
<li>Shields are for blocking ONLY. Your shield should never be used as a weapon. Shield-bashing or other shield contact with another person is unsafe.</li>
<li>Pommels, no matter how padded, are not legal striking surfaces. Do not punch or thrust with the pommel of a weapon.</li>
<li>Do NOT ever throw a weapon at a participant, unless that weapon is of a type (magic missile, javelin, or lightning bolt) sanctioned by the rules for throwing. No thrown weapon or missile weapon should strike a participant above the shoulders.</li>
<li>Arrows should be drawn with minimal pull necessary to score a successful hit. Bows should NEVER be used to parry an attack. As with thrown weapons, arrows should not strike a participant above the shoulders.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="combat-in-the-realms">3: Combat in the Realms</h1>
<h2 id="the-combat-system">3.1: The Combat System</h2>
<p>The Realms uses a lightest-touch system for its combat system. That means that no matter how lightly your opponent may touch you with their weapon, you have to take the shot. This is to keep the sport friendly, so that everyone can play. This system does not allow for “scratches” or “light blows” - you must take these shots as normal blows. In all cases, the phrase, “if you are struck,” refers to any time you are struck by the padded surface of any weapon or spell prop that does damage as a weapon.</p>
<h3 id="hit-locations">Hit Locations</h3>
<p>Your body is separated into seven locations of which there are two kinds. Your arms and legs are “limbs,” while your head and the front and back of your torso are “kill locations.” If you become confused about exactly where one location stops and another begins, thinking of a Barbie™ doll may help. The buttocks of a person are considered leg shots. If you are hit in the buttock(s), you lose the appropriate leg(s).</p>
<h3 id="killing-blows">Killing Blows</h3>
<p>If you are struck in a kill location your PC is dead (see <a href="#character-death">Section 3.4: Character Death</a> and <a href="#scalping">Section 3.5: Scalping</a> for more details).</p>
<p>If you are hit on the top of the shoulder, your PC is dead. If you are wearing armor, a blow to the top of the shoulder is considered a blow to the front or back depending on whether your opponent is in front of you or behind you.</p>
<h3 id="limb-shots">Limb Shots</h3>
<p>If you are struck in a limb, your PC loses the use of that entire limb. If you are struck in a limb that has already been lost, and that limb blocked what could have possibly been a legal shot to another location, then that location should be considered hit. You cannot protect the side of your PC’s body with a disabled arm or by lifting a disabled leg up to block. Once your PC’s limb has been disabled, it should be put behind you. This keeps it out of the way as well as provides a visual cue to other players that your PC is hurt. Once you have lost a limb, your PC cannot use that limb at all. Don’t limp on a damaged leg.</p>
<h3 id="hand-on-weapon">Hand-on-Weapon</h3>
<p>If you are struck on a hand that is holding anything that is legal to block or parry with (weapons and shields, but not bows, javelins or arrows), it is considered gauntleted and immune to damage. When this happens, call out “Hand” or “Hand-on-weapon.” If you are struck on a hand that is not holding anything you can parry with, even if you have just taken it off for a second, it is considered a legal limb shot and your PC has to suffer the consequences. Your hand is considered everything below the wrist bone.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-take-multiple-hits">How to Take Multiple Hits</h3>
<p>Should an opponent’s weapon (be it a melee weapon, missile weapon, or spell prop) hit you in more than one location with the same swing, all points of contact count as hits.</p>
<h2 id="combat-etiquette">3.2: Combat Etiquette</h2>
<p>Combat is an important part of the game. In order to make the game more fun for everyone, combat etiquette, which is OOC, has been developed. Using combat etiquette helps avoid confusion and promotes the same kind of behavior when someone else is fighting you.</p>
<h3 id="calling-hits">Calling Hits</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility to call where you were hit in combat. This is to let the other participant(s) and the marshals know that you were hit, and where you were hit. Calling armor, protections, and other effects is also your responsibility. Armor must always be called, even when a PC is dead. It is not acceptable to call another player’s hits for them. If you feel that another participant is consistently miscalling their hits, missing shots, or some other form of cheating, please alert a marshal. It is acceptable to ask your opponent if they were hit, calling their attention to the location.</p>
<h3 id="late-shots">Late Shots</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will strike another participant immediately after receiving a hit that injures or kills your PC. For example, just before your sword makes contact with an opponent, your attacking arm is struck by another weapon. Even though you are incapable of physically halting your attack, the injury your PC received renders the hit ineffective. There is no “follow through” effect that allows your attack to be successful. This is called a late shot. If you deliver a late shot, it is your responsibility to inform your opponent to not take the blow. Common phrasing includes “Don’t take that!” or “Late, on your arm!” Like other shots, you may not declare that someone else hit you late. If you think someone is failing to call their late shots, question them after combat ends, or bring your concern to a marshal.</p>
<h3 id="illegal-hits">Illegal Hits</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may hit someone with a part of your weapon that doesn’t actually damage their PC, such as the pipe of a weapon, the side of a thrust-only weapon (see <a href="#weapon-rules">Section 3.7: Weapon Rules</a>), or the shaft, fletching or nock of an arrow or javelin. If you do this, be sure to call “Don’t take that!” to alert them that it wasn’t a legal hit, and that they may resume play as if the hit never occurred. A player may also call “shaft” if they received an illegal hit from an arrow or javelin, or call “slash” if they received an illegal hit from a thrust-only weapon.</p>
<h3 id="missing-shots">Missing Shots</h3>
<p>Sometimes in the thick of battle people miss shots, because of adrenaline or focus. This is generally unintentional and accidental. It often stops once a fighter has more experience in calling and feeling their shots. Repeatedly missing shots or intentionally missing shots is different and is cheating. If you repeatedly miss shots, you may be asked to get retrained in fighting, or may be asked to stop playing.</p>
<h3 id="off-target-areas">Off-Target Areas</h3>
<p>Your face and the front of your throat are off-target; players should never aim attacks there. If you are hit in either location, you should announce it even though the hit has no game effect. Face is considered the area on your head below your eyebrows, in front of your ears. Throat is considered the forward-facing section of your neck, above the sternum. The forehead from the eyebrows up, the back and top of your head, and the sides and back of your neck are all legal targets.</p>
<p>Should an opponent’s weapon hit you in more than one location with the same swing and one or more of those blows land in an off-target area (such as your face or your throat), you still have to accept those blows which did land in legal locations.</p>
<p>Breast shots and groin shots are legal and considered killing shots, but such shots are highly discouraged. Everyone is encouraged to wear protective gear to avoid injury to sensitive areas.</p>
<p>You should never deliberately aim for an off-target area (face with any weapon, or head with a ranged weapon) or the groin or breasts. Accidents happen, but if you frequently target these sensitive areas it will indicate to others that you are not a safe and controlled fighter, and you may be asked to sit out by a marshal.</p>
<h2 id="armor">3.3: Armor</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-armor">Types of Armor</h3>
<p>Your PC may be able to wear armor. Armor allows a PC to take blows without taking injuries. There are two kinds of armor: heavy and light. Heavy armor will absorb two blows per hit location before you have to take the shot. Light armor will absorb one blow per hit location.</p>
<p>Light armor is a thin, pliable kind of armor. Light armor can be made out of multiple layers of quilting or a moderate weight of leather. A quilted cloth jerkin or a thin leather helmet are examples of 1-point armor. Garment-weight leather (such as suede pants or moccasins) is not suitable for light armor.</p>
<p>Heavy armor is in general bulkier, rigid, and more cumbersome than light armor. Hard-boiled leather, heavy-weight leather, studded leather/cloth, brigandine, and chainmail/platemail are classic examples of 2-point armor. Any armor that is studded must have at least one metallic component every square inch to count as heavy armor.</p>
<p>Armor must allow you to feel blows through it and it must look like it would fit in a medieval or fantasy setting.</p>
<h3 id="calling-your-armor">Calling Your Armor</h3>
<p>Armor protects by hit location, so if you have more than one piece of armor on a hit location, it is all considered damaged when you are struck there. On the other hand, if one piece of armor covers more than one hit location, it is treated as separate hit locations. The armor hit locations are divided up by the hit locations for taking wounds and kills. Light armor allows you to call out “Armor 1” on that hit location and the next blow will do damage. If you are wearing heavy armor you should call out “Armor 1” then “Armor 2” before the hit location takes damage.</p>
<p>You can be wearing armor on a hit location yet still have some areas of that hit location that are not covered. These sections are also considered armored if at least 75% of the entire hit location is covered by armor. If some of that armor is light and some is heavy then the uncovered areas can only call out “Armor 1”. If all of the armor on the hit location is heavy then then the uncovered areas can call both points of armor. A marshal should be asked to rule whether or not 75% of the location is covered in any case where it is ambiguous.</p>
<p>For example, if you are wearing a thin leather upper-arm bracer and a metal lower-arm bracer on your right arm, only a leather upper-arm bracer on your left arm, and a chainmail shirt that goes down to your knees: a shot to anywhere on your lower-left arm disables your PC’s left arm. The upper bracer was not struck and thus has no benefit. A shot to the upper portion of your left arm damages the upper-arm bracer. Your PC still has the limb, but the armor on that limb is gone. A shot to the lower-right arm bracer damages all the arm armor. You still have a point of armor left on the lower bracer, but if you are hit on the upper-right arm bracer, your PC will lose the limb. Had the next shot also hit the right lower-arm bracer, all the right arm armor would be gone. Three shots to a leg covered by the chainmail skirt would destroy all of the armor on that leg and disable the PC’s leg as well. Even though the armor protecting the leg and the armor protecting the torso is all one piece, you can still take two shots to the armor on your front torso, back torso, and your other leg before the armor in those locations is completely destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="character-death">3.4 Character Death</h2>
<p>As players experience the game through the eyes of their characters, PC death becomes an important aspect of the game.</p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>Death occurs in many ways. Usually, death of a character happens when something, such as a weapon, hits a character in an unarmored kill location. Certain spells may also kill a character, from magic missiles to ingesting poisons or other more esoteric means. Death renders the character incapable of any action until such time as a spellcaster or item, with the power to heal the dead, raises the character, or magic that regenerates or animates them takes effect.</p>
<p>Death can be repaired by many spells, abilities, and items. Be sure to go over <a href="#combat-in-the-realms">Part 3: Combat in the Realms</a> and <a href="#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know">Section 6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone Should Know</a> for more details on what causes and cures death.</p>
<p>In the Realms there are two states of death. They are death (or dead), and scalped (see <a href="#scalping">Section 3.5</a> for more information on Scalping).</p>
<p>If your PC is dead or scalped, you should lie or sit still. Try not to look around or talk. Do your best to role-play a corpse. Don’t get upset if someone hits you with a killing blow when you are already dead. If somebody does this just say, “Dead.” They are making sure that you really are dead.</p>
<p>In tournaments, or other high combat situations, it is acceptable for a character to move out of the way to avoid being stepped on. They may resume their death act in a safer place. They may also sit or kneel to avoid injuries. If you are role-playing death in any of these forms, you should put your weapon over your head to signify your character is dead.</p>
<p>If someone looks at you and asks you to describe your wounds, do your best to comply. If you were backstabbed and you’re lying on your back, tell them they don’t see any wounds. Then, if they roll you over to look at your back, tell them they see a deep wound in your back.</p>
<p>When your PC is killed (dead, but not scalped) and then raised, they may remember everything up until the point of their death.</p>
<h3 id="playing-dead">Playing Dead</h3>
<p>It is legal for characters to lie down and pretend they are dead, but they may not put their weapons over their head. If someone asks a player if their character is dead, the player and the character are not obligated to answer, but if a player is asked to describe their character’s wounds, they should do so as accurately and honestly as possible. If their character is not really dead and someone comes close to them to loot their character’s body, they are free to attack the unsuspecting looters. If you are unsure as to whether someone’s character is dead and want the character to be, tap the player gently in a kill location.</p>
<h2 id="scalping">3.5: Scalping</h2>
<p>Scalping is the removal of a character’s life essence through mutilation of the body. It is a more serious form of death that requires more than a simple spell to repair. Scalped characters cannot be raised or animated until their soul has been restored.</p>
<h3 id="scalps">Scalps</h3>
<p>A scalp is a token carried by each player, which represents the life essence of that player’s character. Players must be carrying their PC’s scalp at all times; unless the PC is dead and scalped (see below), or unless they are under the influence of a spell which removes the PC’s scalp. Scalps must have their player’s name and the PC’s name written legibly on it. A scalp does not exist physically in the IC world therefore it cannot be searched. A scalp is a non-magical and non-stealable marshaling tool.</p>
<h3 id="how-characters-are-scalped">How Characters are Scalped</h3>
<p>In order to scalp a body, you must strike 200 blows with a weapon beside the body of the character being scalped. More than one person may scalp a body at a time. More than one weapon may be used to scalp a body as well. This effectively divides the number of blows to be struck between the number of participants and number of weapons used. Some monsters and characters under certain spells may require more scalping blows to completely destroy. If you strike 200 blows and the victim says “The job is not yet done,” then the scalping is not yet complete. Some spells, such as <a href="#potion-of-acid">Strange Brew: Potion of Acid</a> and <a href="#assassins-blade">Assassin’s Blade</a>, may accelerate the act of scalping.</p>
<p>After the scalping is finished, the player of the scalped character must present their character’s scalp to the character that just scalped them. It is then that player’s responsibility to present the scalp to an EH or an appointed marshal. The EH must be informed immediately of the scalping, thus allowing the EH time to prepare for those who might wish to return the scalped character to life.</p>
<p>Characters that are pretending to be dead should interpret any scalping blows as blows to the closest kill location. So, if your PC is pretending to be dead and someone starts to scalp them, the first blows that are struck on the ground next to you should be played as if they were striking your PC on the nearest kill location, destroying any undamaged armor, and then killing them.</p>
<p>If your PC is killed and scalped, they will not remember anything about how they died should they manage to be raised.</p>
<p>Should your PC be dead at the end of an event without being raised, even if the character was not actively scalped, the PC will be considered scalped.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-a-scalped-character">Fixing a Scalped Character</h3>
<p>To restore someone to life after scalping, characters must first have the body of the person needing to be raised. Then characters must either cast a <a href="#call-the-soul">Call the Soul</a>, an <a href="#intervention">Intervention</a> spell, or administer a <a href="#potion-of-soul-snare">Potion of Soul Snare</a> (see <a href="#strange-brew">Strange Brew</a>) to summon and reattach the scalp. If characters lack the body, only an <a href="#intervention">Intervention</a> spell will be able to return the scalped PC back to life. When the body and scalp are reunited, characters must cast one <a href="#raise-dead">Raise Dead</a> spell for each event (including the first) since the scalped PC was scalped in order to raise them. A different spellcaster must provide each <a href="#raise-dead">Raise Dead</a> spell used for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-death">3.6: Permanent Death</h2>
<p>When a PC is dead and scalped at the end of an event at which they were at some point alive, they get a “tick.” PCs may also receive ticks due to use of certain magic items or plot interactions. A PC is only obligated to accept one involuntary tick per event. A PC that accumulates three or more ticks is permanently dead, as their soul can no longer be restored by any means. On January 1st of each new year, one tick is removed from each PC that has any, unless they are already permanently dead. If a PC is killed and scalped during an event, but returned to life before the end of the event, they do not get a tick.</p>
<p>For a scalping to be official, it must be brought to the EH’s attention. The EH must provide the Death Marshal with this scalping information from their events. A tick may only be issued or reported by a legal EH of the event where the tick was incurred or by the player whose PC received the tick. The Death Marshal will keep track of this information. The current Death Marshal is Keith Cronyn who can be reached at <a href="mailto:Keith.Cronyn@gmail.com" class="email">Keith.Cronyn@gmail.com</a> or at 603-819-8689.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-rules">3.7: Weapon Rules</h2>
<p>Players are responsible for being safe with the weapon(s) they are using. Before using a weapon style in-game, players should take it upon themselves to be properly trained by a marshal or someone who is safe and proficient with that weapon style.</p>
<h3 id="wielding-weapons">Wielding Weapons</h3>
<p>For the purposes of the rules, you are wielding a weapon or shield if you are holding it in your hand(s) and you attack, parry, or block with it. You are wielding a combination of weapons and/or a shield if you attack, parry, or block with either of them. Simply holding a weapon, or menacing with it, does not count as wielding unless contact is made. You cannot wield more than one item in a hand at once.</p>
<p>If you are wielding an illegal weapon or combination and you attack, then you should tell the target “Don’t take that.” If something you are not wielding blocks a shot, then you should treat the blow as if it had landed. If you are not sure where that blow would have landed, then assume it would hit the location that would cause you the most harm (e.g., an unarmored kill location). There are special restrictions for spellcasters in terms of wielding and blocking with different weapons, and specific consequences for doing so outside of the spellcaster’s restriction. See <a href="#breaking-weapon-restrictions">Breaking Weapon Restrictions</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The size of a weapon dictates how it may be wielded. Weapons cannot be any smaller than 12", and cannot exceed 8’ in length.</p>

<h3 id="one-handed-weapons">One-Handed Weapons</h3>
<p>You can wield a one-handed weapon or shield in one hand and still use another one-handed weapon or shield in the other hand. Using two one-handed weapons (up to 3’8" each) together, one in each hand, is commonly called a “Florentine” combination. Magic Missiles are also considered one-handed weapons, but follow special rules (see <a href="#magic-missile">Magic Missile</a>, under Spell Descriptions).</p>
<h3 id="hand-and-a-half-weapons">Hand-and-a-Half Weapons</h3>
<p>If a weapon is considered hand-and-a-half, then you can use the weapon with one hand, but your other arm or hand cannot be holding a weapon or a shield. Lightning bolts are also considered hand-and-a-half weapons. Bows are wielded as hand-and-a-half weapons, but follow special rules (see <a href="#bows">Bows</a> below).</p>
<h3 id="two-handed-weapons">Two-Handed Weapons</h3>
<p>If a weapon is two-handed, you may only wield the weapon with two hands. Every blow you strike must be started with two hands. If you lose an arm while wielding a two-handed weapon, you may not attack with that weapon. You may parry with a two-handed weapon with only one hand, but only if you are not wielding something else with your other hand.</p>
<p>Every blow you strike with a two-handed weapon must begin with both hands on the weapon. If you let go with one hand during the swing, the swing is still legal. Once the initial swing has ended, the attacker will have to grab the weapon with two hands again before making another attack.</p>
<h3 id="thrust-only-weapons">Thrust-Only Weapons</h3>
<p>Thrust-only weapons cannot strike an opponent with a “slashing” or side-to-side motion. If you slash at an opponent with a thrust-only weapon, you must tell them “Don’t take that.” As long as the tip of the weapon strikes with a forward motion the blow must be taken. If you are not certain that a thrust-only strike landed properly, you must assume it was a slash and tell your opponent not to take the shot.</p>
<h3 id="spears-thrust-only">Spears (Thrust-only)</h3>
<p>A spear is a thrust-only weapon between 4’ and 5’ in length. These weapons may be used as a single-handed weapon if used alone or with a shield. Spears may not be used with other weapons. Their length must be between 1/3 to 1/2 covered in foam and they must be clearly labeled with the word “Spear” on the blade. Once being labeled as a spear the weapon must stay thrust-only even if it is legally made to regular slashing hand-and-a-half standards.</p>
<h3 id="bows">Bows</h3>
<p>A bow is wielded as if it were a hand-and-a-half weapon. This means that it may not be held when a weapon or shield is being wielded in your other hand, but it is legal to fire it with one hand— if you can! A bow is not considered a “weapon” for purposes of determining whether a spell fails; arrows are considered weapons and will cause some spells to fail.</p>
<p>Bows must have a draw-weight of 30 pounds or less. Just like melee weapons, you should be careful on how hard your arrows are striking your opponent. Arrows should be drawn with the minimal pull necessary to score a successful hit.</p>
<p>If a weapon hits a wielded bow or nocked arrow, the bow is “broken” and may no longer be used in combat. Anyone can fix a broken bow by holding the bow with both hands, then counting to 200 seconds. You cannot actively parry with a bow or an arrow.</p>
<h3 id="javelins">Javelins</h3>
<p>A javelin is wielded as if it were a single-handed weapon. This means that it may be held when a weapon or shield is being wielded in your other hand. A javelin is considered a weapon for the purposes of spells.</p>
<h3 id="missile-weapons">Missile Weapons</h3>
<p>Projectile weapons such as arrows, crossbow bolts, spells (like Magic Missile), and javelins cannot be targeted at your opponent’s head. Head shots from projectile weapons, even if they did not hit the face or the throat, do not have to be taken as legal shots.</p>
<p>Being struck with any portion of the foam head of the arrow or javelin will cause damage. The shaft, fletching, and nocks of arrows and javelins do not cause damage.</p>
<p>All projectile weapons, with the exception of arrows and javelins, are live and inflict damage on any target they hit until they come to rest, regardless of whether they hit the ground, a wall, a weapon, a tree, or any other obstacle along the way. In the case of arrows and javelins, an arrow or javelin is considered live and is able to inflict damage until it comes into contact with the ground. If an arrow or javelin hits you after it comes into contact with the ground it does no damage. It is the responsibility of the player wielding the bow or javelin to tell you not to take the blow. A player may also call “shaft” if they received an illegal hit from an arrow or javelin.The length of javelins and arrows are not subject to a spellcaster’s weapon restriction.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-construction">3.8: Weapons Construction</h2>
<p>There are several ways to make weapons in the Realms. If you are playing for the first time, it might be a better idea to borrow weapons than try to make any of your own. Once you have seen what other weapons have looked like and asked a few questions on how others have made their weapons, then you will be better prepared to construct your own.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow these guidelines when constructing a weapon: * All non-missile melee weapons must be made out of lightwall PVC, fiberglass, or bamboo cores as noted in the table below. There can be nothing in the core. Both ends must be capped with a rigid material. * All weapons must have a thrusting tip (the pipe foam that extends beyond the tip of the pipe) as noted below. * A weapon’s striking surface must be made from closed-celled foam pipe insulation, which must be at least 5/8" thick and which must be firmly strapping-taped in place. All striking surfaces must be covered in either duct tape or fabric. Only magic weapons should be made with a blue-colored striking surface, and you may only make a magic weapon through the use of spells in the magic system, or if you are releasing one as an EH.</p>

<li>All shields must have their edges covered by foam. Any protruding metal screws or bolts should also be padded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="equipment-inspections">3.10: Equipment Inspections</h2>
<p>You must inspect any armor, weapon, or shield before using it. If you are unsure about an item’s safety, ask a marshal and they will inspect it for you. Any item can be inspected at any time during an event at anyone’s request. This is meant for the purpose of ensuring safety and should never be used for strategic or tactical purposes. The EH or a designated marshal retains final ruling on the approval for use of any armor, weapon, or shield.</p>
<h3 id="armor-inspection">Armor Inspection</h3>
<p>Armor can be failed or the point value of armor may be adjusted for many reasons. Armor can have exposed edges that could cause a safety concern for the wearer or other combatants. The EH or designated marshal retains final ruling on the point value and approval for use of armor.</p>
<h3 id="shield-inspection">Shield Inspection</h3>
<p>Shields can be failed for many reasons. A shield can have exposed edges or protrusions that could cause a safety concern for the wearer or other combatants. A shield can be failed if it has seen too much abuse and has not been repaired recently. The EH or designated marshal retains final ruling on the approval for use of a shield.</p>
<h3 id="weapon-inspection-1">Weapon Inspection</h3>
<p>Weapons can be failed for many reasons. A weapon can have too much “whip” (one that flexes too much) or not enough “whip” (one that doesn’t flex at all). There is no standard way of measuring flex, you will have to use your common sense. A weapon can be failed if it has seen too much abuse and has not been repaired recently. The most common problem weapons have is that their thrusting tips are breaking down or have been compacted. The EH or marshal retains final ruling on the approval for use of a weapon.</p>
<h2 id="combat-calls-section">3.11: Combat Calls</h2>
<p>Combat calls are what you may hear yelled in combat, and you must know how these calls affect your PC.</p>
<h3 id="armor-1">Armor</h3>
<p>Negates a hit attack. When “Armor” (or “Armor 1,” “Armor 2,” or “Armored Cloak”) is called in combat, it means that the person calling armor is protected against the attack that landed on them, usually by means of armor or a spell effect.</p>
<h3 id="armor-piercing">Armor-Piercing</h3>
<p>Armor cannot always protect a PC from certain attacks. If an opponent attacks a PC in any way and calls out “Armor-Piercing,” any of the armor that is struck by the attack is completely destroyed, and the PC suffers the effect of the blow as if they were not wearing armor. For example, if a PC is wearing heavy armor on their right arm, and an opponent hits it while calling “Armor-Piercing,” the PC’s armor is destroyed on that arm and they lose the limb.</p>
<h3 id="boulder">Boulder</h3>
<p>A PC can encounter a boulder call in one of two ways: being hit with a physical boulder prop or by a weapon simulating the effects of a boulder. In either instance, the same call of “Boulder!” is used.</p>
<p>If you or any of your equipment are hit by the call of “Boulder!”, you suffer the following effects: your character is dead, any armor hit is “broken” where the boulder touched the locations, magic items hit by the boulder are disenchanted, and any non-monetary equipment (i.e. non-enchanted weapons, bows, and shields) that is hit by the boulder is “broken.” It is the player’s responsibility to see that items damaged this way are not used until the appropriate repair spells are cast upon them.</p>
<p>A boulder prop is often represented by throwing large duct-taped chunks of foam or beanbag chairs with the zippers duct-taped over. When thrown, the boulder is active until it comes completely to rest. PCs may not throw or pick up boulders. Four or more PCs, using a total of eight hands on the boulder, may work together to “push” a boulder along, to free trapped gear and companions, but not to cause damage.</p>
<h3 id="disease">Disease</h3>
<p>If a weapon strikes a PC and the wielder calls “Disease,” wounds on their body take twice as many spells to be healed until the disease is cured. This effect only damages a PC, not their armor. For example, if you are hit by a diseased blow to the leg, <a href="#heal-limb">Heal Limb</a> would need to be cast twice on the leg for it to be healed until the disease is cured. Similarly, if you are killed by a disease shot, the spell <a href="#raise-dead">Raise Dead</a> will need to be cast twice on you until you are cured of the disease.</p>
<p>Regeneration effects will still affect a diseased character with a single use, but the regeneration time is doubled until the disease is cured. Disease can affect both living and dead characters.</p>
<h3 id="fireball">Fireball</h3>
<p>If you or any of your equipment are hit by the call of fireball, your character is dead. Armor and weapons hit by the fireball are not broken, but also do not protect against its damage.</p>
<p>The fireball call may come in the form of a thrown prop (as with a magic missile) or as a weapon blow. Fireball is magical in nature.</p>
<h3 id="flat">Flat</h3>
<p>To “knock out” an opponent, the attacking player must call out the word “Flat” prior to their attack. Should a successful killing blow be struck, they have instead rendered their foe unconscious for a steady count of 300 seconds. The unconscious PC may be wakened sooner by having another PC come and wake them up by touching the unconscious PC and saying “Wake Up.” The PC can also wake up when any damage is inflicted on them. You may call “Flat” at any time, even in the middle of a fight. This form of attack deals no damage to armor.</p>
<h3 id="impale">Impale</h3>
<p>Impaling is the act of holding a weapon in an opponent’s kill location after death, and saying the word “Impale.” It counts as continuous, non-scalping blows to that location. The act of impaling will bypass any armor, damaged or not. While impaled, a character cannot be raised or animated and is unable to regenerate. The results can vary when impaling NPCs.</p>
<h3 id="lightning-bolt-call">Lightning Bolt</h3>
<p>If you are hit by any part of a white boff arrow and the thrower calls “Lightning Bolt,” your PC is struck as if by a magic armor-piercing weapon (see the <a href="#magic-call">Magic</a> and <a href="#armor-piercing">Armor-Piercing</a> calls in this section).</p>
<h3 id="poison">Poison</h3>
<p>There may be occasions where a PC is struck with a blow and the wielder calls “Poison.” If this strike damages a PC in any location, be it torso, arm, leg, etc., then the PC is killed. When the blow does no damage to a PC, such as a hit to an off-target area or a hit to armor that protects the PC, then the poison has no effect. Armor struck with a poison blow is still used. If a PC is under the effects of a spell that protects them from poison in some fashion, the PC still takes the normal damage from the blow but the poison will have no additional effect. Players should also call “Immunity to Poison,” to allow an opponent to understand that you recognized that the blow was poisoned.</p>
<h3 id="weapon-type-and-material-calls">Weapon Type and Material Calls</h3>
<p>Occasionally, more powerful monsters are only affected by certain weapon types or by certain materials. For example, axe-mace trolls are typically only injured by axes and maces; werewolves are only affected by weapons made of silver. It might be a good habit when using a melee weapon other than a sword, to call the type of weapon you are using as you swing. If using a mace, say “Mace” with each swing. When you are wielding a non-normal weapon (e.g., magic or silver), that weapon will always strike with the same effect therefore you must call that effect with every swing.</p>
<h3 id="magic-call">Magic</h3>
<p>If a weapon strikes you and the wielder calls “Magic” (or “Magic Missile”), it means your PC has been hit with a magical blow. Generally, being hit by magic doesn’t affect your PC any differently than being hit by a normal weapon, but sometimes PCs are under spell effects where it makes a difference.</p>
<h3 id="silver">Silver</h3>
<p>If a weapon strikes you and the wielder calls “Silver” it means your PC has been hit with a silver blow. Being hit by silver doesn’t affect your PC any differently than being hit by a normal weapon.</p>
<h1 id="non-combat-interactions">4: Non-Combat Interactions</h1>
<h2 id="in-character-and-out-of-character">4.1: In-Character and Out-of-Character</h2>
<h3 id="being-in-character">Being In-Character</h3>
<p>Generally, events officially begin after the safety rules, any specific site rules, and other special event rules have been read aloud to the gathered players.</p>
<p>Once an event has begun, you are expected to be in-character (IC) at all times. This means that you are playing your PC the whole time you are at an event. Staying IC can add greatly not only to your own event experience, but to those who are playing the game around you. When a companion of your PC is “killed” it adds to the tension and drama of the scene if they pretend they are dead, but it breaks the mood completely if they are laughing and making comments.</p>
<p>Your character may feel differently than you do about something, like slavery, magic, politics, or religion. You may be a pacifist, while your character is a bloodthirsty barbarian. If you can remain true to the character, despite your differences, you can make a memorable story for yourself and those around you. Sometimes staying IC is challenging, especially when you know something that your character shouldn’t logically know, but you should try to remain IC when playing. Likewise, when the game is done, leave your character behind.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-character">Breaking Character</h3>
<p>Once an event has begun, breaking character should be done only when necessary. If you must do so, what you say should be prefaced with “Out-of-character,” as in “Out-of-character, where is the tenting area?” That way, the person you are addressing knows that it is a real-world concern, and should be dealt wit differently than a strictly IC concern.</p>
<p>Sometimes when players get really into character, you may begin to wonder whether animosity or other emotions are completely IC. It is acceptable to break character to make sure everything is in fact still IC and no one’s feelings are getting hurt OOC.</p>
<h3 id="out-of-character-only-terms">Out-of-Character-Only Terms</h3>
<p>There are a few terms that should only be used when speaking OOC: “Hold” and “Medic.” Hold is only used in emergencies as it stops the game. Read <a href="#the-safety-rules">Section 2.3: The Safety Rules</a> for more information on the correct use of the word Hold. Medic is used when someone needs immediate real-world medical attention for any reason: an allergic reaction to a bee-sting, a twisted ankle, an asthma attack, etc. Do not call “Medic” for imaginary (IC) injuries. If you need IC medical attention, call “Healer!”</p>
<h3 id="out-of-play-areas-and-time-out">Out-of-Play Areas and Time-Out</h3>
<p>The EH has the option of declaring portions of the event site as “out-of-play” for safety reasons or for NPC use. Never use these out-of-play areas as safe havens.</p>
<p>If a fight breaks out in an area that is unsafe to fight in or that is out-of-play, then the fight should be moved to a safe in-play area. If you are in such an area, you may be asked to leave said area for combat. If you refuse to leave the unsafe area, your PC is considered dead. After the fight, those involved can move back to where the fight “really” took place, and continue on.</p>
<p>An EH is free to create an in-game safe area if they choose. For example, powerful enchantments on the tavern may render weapons and hostile magic inoperable within the tavern walls. In this case, it is fine for players to hide there, since they will be taking advantage of an in-game effect.</p>
<p>EHs may also declare a time-out during an event for sleep, dinner, etc. While on an event site, if you are not acting as an NPC at the EH’s request, or you are not in a time-out, a character is liable to be attacked, and their possessions open to theft.</p>
<h2 id="dragging">4.2: Dragging</h2>
<p>To drag a dead, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated body in our game, you must place a hand on the shoulder, back, or arm of the body and say “Drag.” The player being dragged must then get up and walk with you, bringing what they are carrying with them. Stealable items stay on a dragged corpse unless explicitly searched off. A dragged body is considered one-handed and may not be used as a weapon or a shield. At any time you may tell the dragged player “Drop,” thereby letting go of the player and dropping them on the ground. A body being dragged can never be “thrown” or “tossed.” If the person dragging the body lets go, then the body should drop in place.</p>
<h2 id="searching-and-theft">4.3: Searching and Theft</h2>
<p>There are certain items that are referred to as being “Stealable.” Some examples of stealable items are magic items, magic weapons, Realms currency, silver weapons, and occasionally non-magical items. With the exception of currency, the word “Stealable” is likely written somewhere on the object.</p>
<p>Players must assume that any props or items used by event staff are not stealable unless labeled as such or told otherwise by event staff.</p>
<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>
<p>Searching is a touchy subject. In the real world, if a bandit has just killed someone they can just take everything they own. In the Realms, an object has to be considered stealable to be taken from a person or location without the owner’s permission. The problem is that often these stealable items are not easily recognizable, especially the smaller items. Also, while “secret pockets” and such seem like a good idea at first, frisking a dead character could be considered a form of harassment towards the player and should be avoided. To handle this situation, the searching rule exists.</p>
<p>The searching rule is verbose because there have been a lot of problems about searching in the past. The rule is mostly common sense. Once you think about it, it will seem quite simple. There are two ways you can search someone, using a Point Search or Full Search.</p>
<h3 id="point-search">Point Search</h3>
<p>To simulate ransacking a character’s pouches, weapons, and clothing quickly, a player can “point search.” Essentially, the searcher says “Search” and tells the victim where they are searching (e.g., “I search your pouch.”) If there are stealable items in the area being searched, then all the items in that area are handed over immediately. The area that a person point-searches cannot be any larger than one hit location on the body (e.g., you would have to search each sleeve of a shirt and the front and back of a shirt to search everywhere inside the shirt). Pockets and pouches have to be pointed out to be searched. You cannot say “I’m searching all your pockets,” you have to search each one individually; left and right sleeves, boots, gloves, etc., all have to be searched separately, one at a time. Only one person can point search a victim at a time. Point searching does not wake up an unconscious character.</p>
<h3 id="full-search">Full Search</h3>
<p>The other way to search someone is to simulate taking your time to do it thoroughly. That is, the character simulates stripping the body from head to toe, ripping everything to shreds, garnering every last item you own, etc. In order to do this the searcher simply says “Full search.” Every stealable item the victim has must be handed over to the searcher. The characters should take 120 seconds to do this. If so, then the items should be considered the IC possessions of the searching character. Full searching will wake up an unconscious character.</p>
<p>If someone full-searches a character and a different character comes by during that time and point-searches the victim, the full search is stopped and the point search is resolved. If a character does not specify what kind of search they are performing, then it is assumed that they are performing a point search. If told only that they are being searched, the player whose character is being searched must assume it is a point search and respond, “Where?”</p>
<h3 id="realms-thieves">Realms Thieves</h3>
<p>The only objects that are always in-play, are fair game for theft, and can be stolen without consulting the bearer of the object, are those considered stealable in-game (see <a href="#in-game-items">Section 4.4: In-Game Items</a>, below). In order to steal any other object, you must have the explicit permission of the owner/bearer before making the theft. This means that to steal another PC’s jewelry (assuming that some of it is considered treasure), you must ask the person who plays that PC. One way to do this is to kill or flat the character and tell them that you are searching them. If they have anything that is in-play, they must show it to you, for you to take or leave as you wish. You should never pick up something off a table or from in front of someone’s tent, unless it is a magic or silver weapon, or Realms currency.</p>
<p>It should be restated that people’s tents, bags, packs, and pouches are completely off-limits and out-of-play. No matter how many magic or silver weapons, or how much Realms currency someone might have, you may never, under any circumstances, enter their tent or go into their bags, packs, or pouches and take anything out without the owner’s explicit permission.</p>
<p>A magic item is the property of the EH that created it. It is the EH’s will that the item be able to be circulated around the Realms by theft, as a gift, as part of an inheritance, or any other means so long as it occurs at an event.</p>
<p>IC theft, not gift, of stealable items in OOC situations, not at an event, is not acceptable and will not be upheld.</p>
<h2 id="in-game-items">4.4: In-Game Items</h2>
<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>
<p>Various groups and nations issue different currencies for use as treasure and to pay for goods and services in-game. These currencies are often represented by stamped metal disks or roofing tins, sometimes bearing printed stickers for identification or are minted in metals, plastic or even clay. In-game these currencies usually represent Gold or Silver. Denominations vary from currency to currency. Generally ten silver pieces are worth one gold piece. The more prized issues are backed, meaning that if you accumulate enough of any one currency, you can trade those coins in to the issuer for goods, weapons, or services. Many older coinages and silver pieces are not backed, and while they’re still in-play, many people either heavily discount them or don’t accept them at all. Issues and worth of coins fluctuate. If you’re in doubt as to what a coin is worth, ask the merchants and the gamblers. Realms currency cannot be counterfeited; to do so is cheating.</p>
<h3 id="silver-weapons">Silver Weapons</h3>
<p>Silver weapons are created by players with the spell <a href="#reforge">Reforge</a> or are released by EHs.</p>
<h3 id="magic-items-and-magic-weapons">Magic Items and Magic Weapons</h3>
<p>All magic items and magic weapons are stealable.</p>
<p>Magic weapons must be made with a blue-colored striking surface, so that they are distinctive. No permanent magic item may be issued by anyone except an EH (see <a href="#realms-administration">Section 7: Realms Administration</a> for more information).</p>
<p>Should a magic item or weapon become broken or disenchanted at an event, it requires a repair through the <a href="#reforge">Reforge</a> spell to return to a functioning state. Additionally, magic items which have been revoked by their EH/creator are no longer considered magic items and also revert back to the EH who created them. Magic weapons that are currently in existence may be re-bladed without the use of a <a href="#reforge">Reforge</a> spell, to repair safety issues, by first contacting and gaining permission from the issuing or backing EH.</p>
<h3 id="event-stealable">Event-Stealable</h3>
<p>The props for certain spells and items as designated by the EH are considered “Event-Stealable,” meaning that they are stealable treasure during an event, but should be returned to their OOC owner when you leave an event. Before you leave an event site, you must return (to the best of your ability) any items marked as “Event-Stealable” to the EH or MM. Props for PC spells are returned by the EH or MM as an OOC courtesy, and will be done so without revealing the identity of the thief. If you have a spell that has an event-stealable prop as a component, you may replace it without penalty at the next event if it is not returned to you for whatever reason. You can never declare permanently stealable items as event-stealable.</p>
<h1 id="character-creation">5: Character Creation</h1>
<h2 id="the-social-structure">5.1: The Social Structure</h2>
<p>The Realms is not governed by a single kingdom. Each nation has its own hierarchy and structure. There are no hard rules for governing the social structure. Claiming land and titles is anyone’s prerogative. The social structure really only has one rule: if you can back up your title or claim then you deserve to hold it. If you can’t, then you should have nothing to complain about if you get put in your place.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-character">5.2: Creating a Character</h2>
<p>If you are already familiar with role-playing in general, or with live action role-playing specifically, you probably already know how to make a character. If you are new to the concept of role-playing, the following questions might help you establish the traits and characteristics of your PC. You should try to answer the questions for yourself, but some suggestions are provided.</p>
<p><em>What is your character’s species?</em> There are as many species available in the Realms as there are minds to create them. In the Realms, there are no restrictions on what species you can play. The only rule is that you may gain no special benefits or specialized abilities for playing a certain race or person (the only way to gain supernatural powers is through legally released items, the spell system, or by being appointed a <em>Knight of the Realms</em> or a <em>Knight of the Eternal Flame</em>). If you create your own “race,” you would do well to consider its mannerisms, average age, codes of ethic, etc. Of course humans are the easiest to play, since you are probably human.</p>
<p><em>What is your character’s age?</em> If you are playing a human character, it is usually best to pick an age near your own. Other species may have different average ages.</p>
<p><em>Why is your character an adventurer?</em> Most people of the Realms prefer the relatively safe life of a farmer or craftsman. Why has your character left home to join in the rather hazardous occupation of hero? The answer to this might give you some valuable insight into the persona of your character.</p>
<p><em>What is your character’s background?</em> There is no limit on where your character came from. As was stated before, your character can come from anywhere, so long as they gain no IC benefits from it.</p>
<p><em>Does your character have a lifetime goal, dream, or driving force?</em> Goals define characters well, and how far they are willing to go to attain that goal rounds them off.</p>
<h2 id="fighters">5.3: Fighters</h2>
<p>Fighters are capable of using any weapon style, to the limits of the <a href="#wielding-weapons">Wielding Weapons</a> section. They may use up to 2-point armor (heavy armor) for each hit location. They are not considered enchanted beings unless stated in the <a href="#enchanted-beings">Enchanted Beings Caveat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="being-a-realms-spellcaster">5.4: Being a Realms Spellcaster</h2>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>The magic system is based on a simple path setup. There are many different paths available to a spellcaster, with each path consisting of a list of spells. A spellcaster may choose to take as many as three paths of spells as they progress, with weapon use becoming more restricted as the number of paths learned increases. Being a spellcaster requires two things: a spellbook and knowledge of the magic system.</p>
<h3 id="spellbooks">Spellbooks</h3>
<p>All spellcasters must have a spellbook, which records details of the spells the spellcaster knows. It is a marshaling tool and cannot be stolen from the PC. A spellcaster must have their spellbook on their person in order to cast spells.</p>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of each spellbook must have the spellcaster’s IC and OOC name, their current weapon restriction, whether the spellcaster wears armor or not, and whether the spellbook is IC or OOC (see below).</li>
<li>Next, the spellbook must have a listing of each spell the character has learned, in order; each spell’s circle; the date each spell was learned; and a note if any spell is unlearned.</li>
<li>The spellbook must have a description of each spell known - including specific components learned for each spell - to which the spellcaster may refer as needed during play.</li>
<li>Lastly, the spellbook must list who taught the spell to the spellcaster on either the page of the spell’s description or the spell list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spellcasters may have a Spell Mastery section at the end of their spellbook. The Spell Mastery section is a list of spells which the spellcaster has learned during their PC’s lifetime. An entry in this list includes the spell’s name, who taught the spell to the spellcaster, and the date it was learned. Spells in this list cannot be cast, unless they are currently in a spellcaster’s path.</p>
<p>Spellbooks may be declared IC or OOC, and so noted on the title page (“IC” or “OOC” in large, clearly written letters). Any change in a spellbook’s IC or OOC status must take place between events, but requires no particular time to make any such change.</p>
<p>If a spellbook is declared IC, it can be read by other characters, and found and perused in a search. Spellcasters have no option to refuse to reveal their IC spellbooks, provided they are legally found in a search of the spellcaster’s person.</p>
<p>If a spellbook is declared OOC, the information summarized above is OOC information only and exists solely as a marshaling tool. It cannot be read by other characters or discovered in a search. Other information written in spellbooks may be read by others, at the owner’s discretion, such as rune sets, history, or lore.</p>
<p>A player may choose to or need to replace their character’s spellbook. This could be due to such situations as loss, damage, illegibility, or a simple desire to improve it. The player should create a new spellbook with contents as close as possible to the prior one. In the case of swapping out an old spellbook which is still available, the required information in it must be copied over to the new one. In the case of the old spellbook being unavailable or unreadable, then the player must make their best effort to recreate the information in the original. At the next event where they play that character, they must inform the Event Holder or Magic Marshal and have it inspected. At the beginning of the spellbook, where their names and weapon restriction is written, they should note that they are replacing their spellbook along with the date and the signature of the inspecting Event Holder or Magic Marshal.</p>
<p>In all cases, spellbooks remain non-stealable items.</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-of-the-magic-system">Knowledge of the Magic System</h3>
<p>All spellcasters are responsible for knowing how the magic system works, specifically the spells they can cast. A spellcaster who misuses their spells is not allowed to claim ignorance as an excuse.</p>
<h3 id="spell-resets">Spell Resets</h3>
<p>During some Realms events, you may be told a spell reset has occurred. This means some portion of your magical resources have been restored to your PC. The specific effects of a spell reset will change from event to event, so be sure to ask the EH or MM for details.</p>
<h3 id="checking-in">Checking In</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, a spellcaster must check in their spellbook with the EH or the appointed MM before using or learning spells (see <a href="#attending-an-event">Section 1.4: Attending an Event</a> for more details).</p>
<h3 id="weapon-restrictions-and-magic">Weapon Restrictions and Magic</h3>
<p>Weapon restrictions are a matter of game balance. See below:</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>Your weapon restriction changes the moment you learn an additional path of magic. Spellcasters starting out know only one path (as they only know a single spell), and thus their restriction is Light.</p>
<p><em>For example:</em> Roderick is currently a one-path with five spells. He decides that using a bow and having more magic is more important than his hand-and-a-half, so he decides to keep learning spells. As soon as he learns his 6th spell, his restriction changes over to being Medial.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-weapon-restriction">Breaking Weapon Restriction</h3>
<p>A spellcaster may carry any weaponry they want, as long as they don’t wield them. In this context, wield means to make use of the weapon in any way, including hitting someone or blocking a blow, whether intentional or not. To wield a weapon outside of your weapon restriction is called “breaking weapon restriction.” (See <a href="#wielding-weapons">Wielding Weapons</a> in <a href="#weapon-rules">Section 3.7: Weapon Rules</a>.</p>
<p>If a spellcaster purposely breaks their weapon restriction, they suffer the consequences of their actions. They immediately lose all of their spells and become a fighter. Any lingering effects, such as <a href="#circle-of-protection">Circle of Protection</a> (but not a <a href="#circle-of-healing">Circle of Healing</a> or <a href="#mystic-forge">Mystic Forge</a>), last until broken or when spells next reset before going away. They are no longer a spellcaster, and function as a non-spellcaster in all ways for a minimum of one year. After that year is over, they may then decide to return to being a spellcaster, but must start over from scratch.</p>
<p>If they break their weapon restriction without realizing it, such as a blow being blocked by a weapon they are carrying for a friend, they have the option of either the previous penalty or taking the blow that was blocked. This decision must be made immediately.</p>
<h3 id="armor-2">Armor</h3>
<p>Armor restrictions are a matter of game balance. Spellcasters may only use light armor (1-point) but at a cost to wear it. See below:</p>
<table style="width:58%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 12%" />
<col style="width: 11%" />
<col style="width: 34%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="odd">

<td>3</td>
<td>Top spell in each path</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, a spellcaster with two paths would be able to have 1st through 4th and 2nd through 5th, and call armor. This may only be done once; you cannot sacrifice the two highest spells of each path in order to be able to wear heavy armor. A spellcaster may choose to start their spellcasting career with this ability, in which case it must be noted in their spellbook. If not, they must spend one event without learning a spell for each path they know in order to gain the ability to wear armor. Similarly, it takes one event without learning a spell or changing weapon restrictions to give up wearing armor and regain the ability to learn their sacrificed spells.</p>
<p>If a Light restriction spellcaster learns more spells and becomes a Medial restriction spellcaster, upon learning their first spell in their second path, they must choose to either lose the ability to wear armor or their 5th circle spell in their first path.</p>
<p>A spellcaster who uses armor (calls “Armor” in response to a blow) in violation of their armor restriction is immediately faced with the same consequences as one who has broken their weapon restriction, and should refer to that section for details.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-characters">5.5: Multiple Characters</h2>
<p>You may have more than one character in this game. However, you may only play one PC per event unless you have EH permission to play multiple characters.</p>
<h2 id="knights-and-knightly-powers">5.6: Knights and Knightly Powers</h2>
<p>There are many knighthoods in the Realms. It is a great honour to be appointed as a knight, and sometimes this honour comes with special powers. For their service to the game, a Knight of the Eternal Flame may, once per calendar year, call “Knight” to protect themselves from one attack. A Knight of the Realms is allowed to do this once per event. Event Holders may choose to grant powers to members of other knighthoods.</p>
<h1 id="magic-in-the-realms">6: Magic in the Realms</h1>
<h2 id="basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know">6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone Should Know</h2>
<p>Even if you are not a spellcaster, and have no desire to become one, there is still some basic information that you are responsible for understanding. In nearly all cases, a spellcaster casting a spell on your PC should explain, either through their VC or as an aside to you, how the spell affects your PC. Even fighters should read the magic system and spell descriptions, so they have a basic understanding of magic in the game and how it might affect them. No spell effect may be ignored unless otherwise specified in the spell system.</p>
<p>The following are some rules about spells that can have an effect on your character on a day-to-day basis. They are included here with some basic information about how they affect you both IC and OOC.</p>
<h3 id="healing-spells">Healing Spells</h3>
<p>When your character is injured or killed, only magic can fix the damage. To raise a character means to return a character to life. Raising a character repairs any injuries to limbs the character may have taken prior to their death and also nullifies the effects of any poisons in their system at the time of their death.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#combat-raise-dead">Combat Raise Dead</a>: this three-word spell will raise a character.</li>
<li><a href="#cry-of-life">Cry of Life</a>: the call of “All in the sound of my voice, rise and fight” raises all dead who hear it.</li>
<li><a href="#group-healing">Group Healing</a>: allows a spellcaster to make a large circle through which they cast a healing spell upon every character in it.</li>
<li><a href="#heal-limb">Heal Limb</a>: this spell allows one wounded limb to be magically healed. The spellcaster will let you know when your character’s limb has been repaired.</li>
<li><a href="#raise-dead">Raise Dead</a>: this spell raises a character. This spell will not work if there is a weapon within 10 feet of the spellcaster. Inform a spellcaster the spell has failed if you know about a weapon near enough to disrupt the spell. A bow is not considered a weapon, but arrows are considered weapons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regeneration-bmeesk">Regeneration</h3>
<p>Some spells grant the ability to regenerate from death. This takes 120 seconds. While this happens, your wounds begin to heal. Until 120 seconds have passed, this grants no benefit. A blow to any kill location on a dead body will cause a regeneration count to reset no matter where the killing blow was inflicted. <a href="#impale">Impaling</a> stops regeneration; the count resets when the weapon is removed. Regenerating from death heals all healable wounds on the body. If examined by another person, wounds can be seen to be regenerating. If you are <a href="#disease">diseased</a>, it takes twice as long to regenerate. The effect ends when you are raised.</p>
<h3 id="combat-spells">Combat Spells</h3>
<p>Certain combat calls (see <a href="#lightning-bolt-call">Lightning Bolt</a> and <a href="#magic-call">Magic Missile</a> in <a href="#combat-calls-section">Section 3.11: Combat Calls</a>) involve a prop that is thrown at a combatant. After the prop has come to rest it is only a physical representation of magic and cannot be moved or touched other than by the person who threw it. It may be seen and guarded but not purposefully hidden (e.g., putting a bucket over it). The prop is not considered a weapon and does not cause <a href="#spell-failure">Spell Failure</a> except while the spell is active (i.e. from when the prop is thrown until it comes to rest).</p>
<h3 id="undeath">Undeath</h3>
<p>Certain spells make your character undead for their duration. Your character will remember what happened to them while they were undead. While undead, your character cannot cross a <a href="#circle-of-protection">Circle of Protection</a>, other than one they created themselves (represented by a circle of rope on the ground), or advance within 5 feet of someone casting <a href="#ward-undead">Ward: Undead</a> or <a href="#ward-enchanted-beings">Ward: Enchanted Beings</a>. This family of spells does not give you the ability to ignore weapon restrictions, nor can you be compelled to forcibly break them. If you have any questions about this, ask the spellcaster when they cast the spell on you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#animate-undead-general">Animate Undead General</a>: if this spell is cast upon you when your PC is dead, your PC becomes an undead creature under the spellcaster’s control. You may not refuse to have your PC turned into an undead, unless under certain magical effects (see <a href="#protect-the-soul">Protect the Soul</a>). You are now playing a greater undead version of your PC and have access to all their spells, abilities, and knowledge. In addition your PC now has the ability to cast <a href="#animate-lesser-undead">Animate Lesser Undead</a> with unlimited castings. The Undead General will die to any damaging magical attacks regardless of location. Your PC must follow the orders of the spellcaster. The spell ends if your PC is slain and raised or simply raised.</li>
<li><a href="#animate-undead">Animate Undead</a>: if this spell is cast upon you when your PC is dead, your PC becomes an undead creature under the spellcaster’s control. You may not refuse to have your PC turned into an undead, unless under certain magical effects (see <a href="#protect-the-soul">Protect the Soul</a>). You are now playing an undead version of your PC and have access to all their spells, abilities, and knowledge. Your PC must follow the orders of the spellcaster. The spell ends if your PC is slain and raised or simply raised.</li>
<li><a href="#animate-lesser-undead">Animate Lesser Undead</a>: if this spell is cast upon you when your character is dead, your character becomes an undead creature under the spellcaster’s control. Lesser undead cannot use any armor or spells regardless of what they normally have. You may not refuse to have your PC turned into an undead, unless under certain magical effects (see <a href="#protect-the-soul">Protect the Soul</a>). <a href="#animate-lesser-undead">Animate Lesser Undead</a> can be used to raise an undead (see <a href="#animate-undead">Animate Undead</a>), but returns the character to un-life, rather than life. Like <a href="#animate-undead">Animate Undead</a>, the spell ends when your PC is slain and raised or simply raised.</li>
<li><a href="#walking-dead">Walking Dead</a>: certain spells will make a PC’s dead body walk without either returning them to life or fully animating them as undead. When a PC is under the effects of these spells, follow these guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Walk at a steady pace, do not run.</li>
<li>Keep any items on you that you would retain if picked up and dragged.</li>
<li>Move to the destination as directly as possible without taking an OOC unsafe path. If the only option is to move into an OOC unsafe situation, then the spell ends and the body falls to the ground.</li>
<li>If another character interferes with the body, such as by attacking them or physically stepping in their way to block them, the effect of the spell ends.</li>
<li>The PC cannot take any actions other than walking; no attacking, searching, picking up items, using magic items, or drinking potions.</li>
<li>The PC is considered to be Undead while the effect lasts. See the <a href="#undead">Undead Caveat</a>.</li>
<li>The main difference between various <a href="#walking-dead">Walking Dead</a> spells is in where the PC must walk to.
<ul>
<li><a href="#beckon-corpse">Beckon Corpse</a>: the PC will stand and walk to the spellcaster as long as they are chanting. If the PC is forced to stop, the spellcaster may have the option to regain their attention and resume chanting, at which point the PC will get back up and continue walking to the spellcaster.</li>
<li><a href="#zombie-walk">Zombie Walk</a>: the PC will follow the spellcaster until the spellcaster either ends the spell, the spellcaster attacks someone, or they are attacked.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potions-bmeesk">Potions</h3>
<p>Potions are disposable magic items that anyone can use. Common forms that potions can take include, but are not limited to something that must be consumed or a scroll that must be read or ripped. In all cases the potion needs to be administered by a living or animated character, and after it is used, cannot be used again.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#potion-of-acid">Potion of Acid</a>: if your PC is dead, and someone indicates they are using an acid potion on you, your PC takes 200 scalping blows. See <a href="#strange-brew">Strange Brew</a> for details.</li>
<li><a href="#potion-of-repair-armor">Potion of Repair Armor</a>: it repairs a hit location of damaged armor in 15 seconds when applied to it.</li>
<li><a href="#potion-of-combat-raise-dead">Potion of Combat Raise Dead</a>: it raises a dead character when used.</li>
<li><a href="#potion-of-heal-limb">Potion of Heal Limb</a>: it heals all of a character’s injured limbs when used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blacksmith-spells">Blacksmith Spells</h3>
<p>Certain spells repair damaged armor and broken items.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#repair-armor">Repair Armor</a>: this will restore one hit location of non-magical armor that has been damaged. For example, the armor on one arm, the chest of a shirt of chainmail, head armor, etc.</li>
<li><a href="#repair-item">Repair Item</a>: this will restore non-magical armor, weapons, and other items that have become damaged or destroyed. This spell has a VC, and it fixes the entire item. For example, all hit locations of someone’s armor, a bow, a boulder-crushed weapon, a shield, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-spells-and-things-you-should-know">Other Spells and Things You Should Know</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#create-poison">Create Poison</a>: if you ingest food or drink that is poisoned through the use of this spell, you will be handed a scroll upon which is written the poison’s effect. You must follow the scroll’s instructions completely. It will either kill your PC, cause them to fall in love with someone, sleep deeply, or tell nothing but the truth. All effects other than death are short-lived. A player that ingests a love poison always has the option of allowing their PC to die if they are OOC uncomfortable with the situation.</li>
<li><a href="#cure-disease">Cure Disease</a> or <a href="#potion-of-cure-disease">Potion of Cure Disease</a>: these spells cure a character of a disease (see <a href="#disease">Disease</a> in the <a href="#combat-calls-section">Combat Calls</a> section).</li>
<li><a href="#immunity-to-poison">Immunity to Poison</a>: this spell makes your PC immune to the very next poison or poison attack that would otherwise affect them. It works only once per use of the spell. Call “Immunity to Poison,” when you use this spell’s effect (see <a href="#poison">Poison</a> in <a href="#combat-calls-section">Section 3.11: Combat Calls</a>).</li>
<li><a href="#light">Light</a>: you may not take the light out of verbal communication range of the spellcaster.</li>
<li><a href="#pas">Pas</a>: this spell creates a temporary truce. If you accept the offered bribe you are magically bound to not attack the spellcaster for 60 seconds unless you are attacked.</li>
<li><a href="#protect-the-soul">Protect the Soul</a>: this spell will protect your PC from possession, <a href="#animate-undead">Animate Undead</a>, and the like.</li>
<li><a href="#speak-with-dead">Speak With Dead</a>: this spell will allow the spellcaster to ask a dead character a single question per casting. Your PC MUST answer truthfully or abstain, using the words, “Yes,” “No,” or “Abstain.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regional-magic">Regional Magic</h3>
<p>At any given event, the EH may wish or require that certain magical abilities be available to the players. One of the ways they can accomplish this is through Regional Magic. Regional Magic is usually an additional number of spells that spellcasters can choose from. Spellcasters can only choose from this list if they had filled at least one spell slot with a Regional Magic spell. Regional Magic is learned and unlearned just like any other spell, and may be learned from anyone who knows it at any circle.</p>
<p>At some events, the Regional Magic your PC will receive is based on which circle spell slot you filled with the Regional Magic spell. At some events, all of the Regional Magic spells are the same, no matter which circle slot you filled with Regional Magic. Others are completely random. Some EHs may require you perform certain actions before gaining the Regional Magic. The details of Regional Magic are left entirely up to the EH. No Regional Magic spell will have a lingering effect that lasts longer than the end of the event. One thing to keep in mind is that while Regional Magic is more versatile, it is also more unreliable. An EH may choose a different spell from the list, a new spell, or nothing.</p>
<h2 id="learning-and-unlearning-spells">6.2: Learning and Unlearning Spells</h2>
<h3 id="choosing-spells">Choosing Spells</h3>
<p>The first step in choosing spells is to decide which 1st circle spell you want to learn. Each path of magic is a list of spells of 5 increasing circles.</p>
<p>A spellcaster may choose one of four options for each circle of a path:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any of the spells listed for that circle.</li>
<li>Any spell of a lower circle.</li>
<li>A Regional Magic spell.</li>
<li>Alchemy</li>
</ul>
<p>When a spellcaster learns their first path of magic, they learn one spell from each of 1st through 5th circles, in order. If they learn a second path, they learn one spell from each of 2nd through 6th circles, possibly learning some spells for a second time. If they learn a third path, they again learn one spell from each of 1st through 5th circles.</p>
<h3 id="learning-progessions">Learning Progessions</h3>
<p>At every event a character attends, they have the possibility of learning one or more spells. If they do not learn a spell at that event, for whatever reason, the opportunity is wasted and they may try again at the next event.</p>
<h3 id="learning-a-spell">Learning a Spell</h3>
<p>There are three ways to learn a spell. You should find a PC who knows the spell and learn it from them. The PC who is teaching the spell must have the spell in their spellbook, must be able to cast the spell at that event, and they must sign the book with their character’s name. If you cannot, or decide that you do not want to learn it from a character who knows it, you can ask the EH to provide you with a quest to learn a single spell. This quest will add a single signature toward learning the spell. Additionally, you may teach yourself a single spell if it is listed in your Spell Mastery section. Your PC does not officially learn the spell until your teacher, teachers, or MM sign your spellbook legibly. Your teacher or teachers are responsible for making sure you understand all of the rules that go with the spell, and may refuse to sign if you seem unable or unwilling to understand the rules. This is important, as the teacher may be held liable for their student if they did not teach them the spell properly.</p>
<p>You may learn as many spells as you are able to prove understanding for; however, at any event, for each additional spell after the first an additional teacher’s signature is required. Your first spell requires one teacher’s signature, your second spell requires two teachers’ signatures, your third spell requires three teachers’ signatures, etc. You must actually attend that event and play that PC. Teaching yourself from Spell Mastery counts as a single teacher’s signature. A teacher or quest giver may only sign off on one spell per player per event.</p>
<h3 id="unlearning-spells">Unlearning Spells</h3>
<p>Any number of spells may be unlearned at check-in of an event. You may not learn a spell at an event where you are unlearning any spells. If you unlearn all the spells in a path, then you no longer have that path, and your restriction immediately changes to match your current number of paths. When you have learned 2 paths, you may not unlearn your first path unless you are also unlearning the second path completely. Likewise when you have learned 3 paths you may not unlearn both paths of magic that include circles 1-5; you may only unlearn one of those paths unless you are also unlearning all of your path that includes circles 2-6. Upon unlearning all your spells, you are no longer considered a spellcaster. Any given spell may not change the path it is in without being unlearned from its original path and relearned in the new path.</p>
<p>For example, Ethan is a 2 path with some healing magic in his second path. He decides that he doesn’t like healing very much, and he misses using a 4’6" weapon. At the next event he attends, he unlearns all of the spells in his second path, and he begins the event at Light restriction.</p>
<p>Fiona is a 3 path, but wants to change her 6th circle spell. The next event she attends, she unlearns her 6th circle spell, remaining under a Severe restriction but without access to a 6th circle spell for the event. At the next event she can learn a new 6th circle spell.</p>
<p>Gunthar wants to become a fighter after being an spellcaster for many years, but he doesn’t want to give up the option of learning spells again later that year. At the beginning of the next event he attends, he unlearns all of his spells and starts as a fighter.</p>
<h3 id="alchemy">Alchemy</h3>
<p>A spellcaster may choose to take Alchemy in a spell slot instead of learning a spell. This still requires someone to teach and sign off their spellbook. Any spellcaster that knows Alchemy must include a points total on their spell list page. Whenever a spellcaster learns Alchemy they receive points equal the chart listed below. For example, if Samuel learns Alchemy in his third and fifth circle slot, he will have 12 points with which to make potions. All spellcasters know three basic potions, listed below, and can learn more with the Strange Brew spell. All Potions are governed by the Enchanted Item and Potions Caveat.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-basics-of-a-spell">6.3: The Basics of a Spell</h2>
<h3 id="spell-components">Spell Components</h3>
<p>Spells have components that are necessary in order to cast the spells. Some are specific, and every player must use the same component to make sure that everyone understands what spell your PC is casting. Some are left open and the spellcaster can choose any component that fits the description. The spell descriptions list the minimal spell components required for each spell. The game does not limit the spellcaster’s freedom to define their own magic, so the required components are as succinct as possible. You may add more requirements for shtick if you like, but you cannot leave out any of the minimums.</p>
<p>Here are the definitions of the different types of components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbal Component (VC): These are the words you have to say while casting the spell. It is important that you enunciate your verbal component and say it loud enough so the person or persons affected can understand what you are saying. The verbal usually explains what spell you are casting. If the target cannot understand you, they are not affected by the spell. A verbal must be written within the spellbook in order to be used, and it must meet the criteria for the spell. Requirements such as “Talk to the EH” or “an explanation” can simply be written as such. Multiple verbals may be written for the same spell, and the caster may choose which to use at casting time. Verbals may be changed between events.</li>
<li>Material Component (MC): There are three types of material components; required, disposable, and foci.
<ul>
<li>Required components are specific to a spell, such as bean-bags, foam, or duct tape blocks for the <a href="#magic-missile">Magic Missile</a> spell. These components cannot vary from what is listed.</li>
<li>Disposable components are up to the player, but they must be something that is consumed or thrown away with every casting of the spell. A disposable component is something that the spellcaster could easily hand to the MM for inspection.</li>
<li>A focus is a component that is not consumed or thrown away. Often, it is necessary for the spellcaster to brandish a focus while casting certain spells. The spellcaster may have a single focus for all of their focus-based spells. A focus is something that another player or NPC can obviously identify as the focus when the spellcaster is using it for a spell. A spellcaster must also be able to hand this to the MM for inspection. A focus may not be a weapon.</li>
</ul>
All MCs must be specified and written down in the PC’s spellbook for every spell that they know and, except for foci, the component must be different for each spell. A spellcaster must have at least one uninjured hand to use a MC.</li>
<li>Active Component (AC): These are actions that the spellcaster must take in order to cast the spell and must be performed at the time of casting. Characters may add anything else for role-playing purposes.</li>
<li>Duration: Unless otherwise noted in the spell description or caveat, all spells end when the event ends.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="caveats">6.4: Caveats</h2>
<p>Caveats are general rules that apply to all spells or spell effects of a similar type. Each spell that is affected by a caveat is listed in the appropriate place.</p>
<h3 id="combat-calls-caveat">Combat Calls</h3>
<p>The spells that allow special combat calls are <a href="#assassins-blade">Assassin’s Blade</a>, <a href="#armor-piercing-weapon">Armor-Piercing Weapon</a>, <a href="#disease-weapon">Disease Weapon</a>, <a href="#enchant-weapon">Enchant Weapon</a>, and <a href="#create-poison">Create Poison</a>. These spells are mutually exclusive and cannot be cast upon a weapon that already has a separate combat call. Weapon types, such as axes or maces, are not covered by this caveat. None of these spells can be cast upon a <a href="#magic-missile">Magic Missile</a> or <a href="#lightning-bolt-spell">Lightning Bolt</a>.</p>
<h3 id="chanting">Chanting</h3>
<p>Some spells require that their VC be chanted continuously for the duration of the spell. These spells do not take effect until the VC has been recited fully, at least once. These spells last as long as the spellcaster continues the chant. OOC explanations (such as combat calls) do not interrupt these spells. For example, if a PC is chanting a <a href="#transmute-self">Transmute Self</a> spell and is hit by a weapon, they may call “No effect” without interrupting the spell; if a PC is chanting a <a href="#ward-undead">Ward: Undead</a> spell and a goblin hits their leg, they can call “Leg” (or “Armor,” or “Armored Cloak,” etc.) without having the spell end. The VC for these spells must be spoken clearly and loudly enough that anyone affected by the spell can understand them. Chanting spells can be disrupted by the 4th circle spell <a href="#disrupt">Disrupt</a>. It is the PC’s responsibility to know what the <a href="#disrupt">Disrupt</a> spell is, how to recognize it, and how to respond to it.</p>
<h3 id="circles">Circles</h3>
<p>There are a number of spells that are considered circle spells. A circle spell must be clearly defined by a length of rope that has been laid on the ground with the ends overlapping. The ends cannot be tied together or secured in any way, and the rope in general cannot be secured or bound in place or the spell fails (see the <a href="#spell-failure">Spell Failure</a> caveat). Only one spell may be cast with a particular rope at a given time, although after the spell ends, a different spell may be cast with that rope. The rope does not need to be laid down in a circular pattern. Although a given circle spell may have a specific way of being broken, all circle spells are broken if the rope is jostled enough to move the ends apart by a character able to cross it. Any circle spell can be suspended by the 4th circle spell <a href="#disrupt">Disrupt</a>. It is the PC’s responsibility to know what the <a href="#disrupt">Disrupt</a> spell is, how to recognize it, and how to respond to it.</p>
<h3 id="compulsions">Compulsions</h3>
<p>Some spells are able to magically compel a character to act in a way the player would prefer they did not. Compulsions can be ignored if they are humiliating or exceedingly difficult commands such as “Kiss my feet” or “Move that wall ten feet to the left.” They also cannot violate OOC mundane laws or ethical codes. They may not force a spellcaster to break their weapon restrictions. Additionally, if the character has been turned undead, they cannot be compelled to communicate knowledge gained before they were made undead.</p>
<h3 id="enchanted-beings">Enchanted Beings</h3>
<p>All spellcasters, undead, and certain creatures are considered to be enchanted beings. Normal fighters are only enchanted beings if under the effect of certain spells, as per the <a href="#undead-caveat">Undead Caveat</a>. Enchanted beings are affected by a certain number of spells, while non-enchanted beings are not. These spells include <a href="#circle-of-protection">Circle of Protection</a> and <a href="#ward-enchanted-beings">Ward: Enchanted Beings</a>. By definition, any creature considered undead is an enchanted being.</p>
<h3 id="enchanted-items">Enchanted Items</h3>
<p>Some spells create or enchant items, or are enhancements that affect players. These spells create magical effects, but are not potent enough for the items bearer or the target of the enchantment to be considered an Enchanted Being, nor is their magic potent enough for the item to be affected by the spell <a href="#circle-of-protection">Circle of Protection</a> once they are cast. If the MC of these spells are disenchanted (through the spells <a href="#disenchant">Disenchant</a> or the <a href="#potion-of-disenchant">Strange Brew: Potion of Disenchant</a> option) the spell will end, rendering the MC inert. Magic items are not covered by the Enchanted Items Caveat.</p>
<h3 id="potions-caveat">Potions</h3>
<p>A spellcaster who learns <a href="#alchemy">Alchemy</a> (not <a href="#create-poison">Create Poison</a>) must have a page in their spellbook listing the sigils that they will use to label potions. Each type of potion they can make, except for poisons, must have a unique, distinguishable sigil. When a potion that isn’t a poison is made, the spellcaster must put their legible signature, the appropriate sigil, and the date upon the container. Once created, all potions are considered stealable items. A potion can be a represented by a liquid, lotion, elixir, magical food, or anything else, as long as it is safe to be administered in a combat situation. Potions must be directly applied to the recipient. They may not be thrown, dropped, or remotely applied in any manner. The spellcaster need not be present in order to use their potions.</p>
<p>Potions take a 60 second process called Brewing to be cast. At the beginning of an event, the spellcaster must describe in general terms their process of brewing. An alchemist may brew as many potions as their spells allow during the same 60 seconds. If they wish to create more later, they must begin the process again. If the alchemist is interrupted while brewing, neither castings nor Alchemy points are lost, but the potions will not be made, and they must start over again in order to make any potions. Although not required, use of additional props or role-playing is encouraged for this process.</p>
<p>No potion created by a player can carry over from one event to another; it expires at the end of the event at which it is cast. The PC may choose whether or not to further limit the lifespan of a potion when it is brewed by writing a distinct expiration time among the required spell information on the container. Any potions lacking a specified expiration time last until the end of the event.</p>
<h3 id="regeneration-caveat">Regeneration</h3>
<p>Some spells grant the ability to regenerate. When this ability is triggered (by death, being wounded, etc.), the target’s wound(s) begin to heal. Until the specified amount of time has passed, this grants no benefit. A blow to any kill location on a dead body will cause a regeneration count to reset no matter where the killing blow was inflicted. Impaling stops regeneration; the count resets when the weapon is removed. Regenerating from death heals all healable wounds on the body. If examined by another person, wounds can be seen to be regenerating. Regeneration that brings a character back from death or scalping takes 120 seconds. If you are <a href="#disease">diseased</a>, it takes twice as long to regenerate. You may only be under the effects of one basic regeneration and one advanced regeneration at a time. If more than one source is causing you to regenerate, you may choose which of those spells is causing you to regenerate. A regeneration will only work on someone who is scalped if the spell directly states that it can.</p>
<h3 id="basic-regeneration">Basic Regeneration</h3>
<p>A basic regeneration is a regeneration from death where the regeneration begins when the target dies (or upon casting the spell if the target is already dead.) The effect is considered used if the target is raised before their regeneration is complete.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-regeneration">Advanced Regeneration</h3>
<p>An advanced regeneration is a regeneration from death or scalping which begins when the character dies (or is scalped if it brings a character back from scalping). Each time they die, the spellcaster may choose to double the length of their regeneration (to 240 seconds, or 480 if diseased). The regeneration is not considered used if the target is raised before their regeneration is complete.</p>
<h3 id="spell-sash">Spell Sash</h3>
<p>Some spells require a Spell Sash be worn to signify that a specific spell is affecting the wearer. A Spell Sash may be constructed as a sash, a tabard, or a belt favor. A Spell Sash must have the name of the spell clearly written on it. Putting the Spell Sash on the target of the spell, or touching it if the target is already wearing it, is considered to be an Active Component of the spell. A Spell Sash is not stealable, and should stay on the target of the spell until the spell is ended, at which time it is removed and returned to the caster at the earliest convenient time. Either the caster or the target may choose to end the spell by removing the Spell Sash, and it is also ended early if the Spell Sash is disenchanted (see <a href="#disenchant">Disenchant</a>). The Spell Sash must be worn in such a way that another player standing 5 feet in front of them can recognise it, and may not be covered unless the majority of their body is covered, such as by wearing a concealing cloak.</p>
<h3 id="spell-failure">Spell Failure</h3>
<p>Some spells have fail conditions in their description. Any spell that fails due to its fail condition expends the casting of that spell.</p>
<h3 id="suspension">Suspension</h3>
<p>While a spell is suspended, the spell has no effect and does not function until the suspension ends. In addition, a suspended spell can be ended any way it normally could. It is the spellcaster’s responsibility to notify anyone else who is affected by this (such as any players carrying potions that the spellcaster created). When the suspension ends, any spell which has not already ended will resume functioning as per normal.</p>
<h3 id="undead">Undead</h3>
<p>Some spells will make a recipient undead. When the spell is cast, the spellcaster must explain to the target what it means to be undead. All undead are affected by the spells: <a href="#circle-of-protection">Circle of Protection</a>, <a href="#ward-enchanted-beings">Ward: Enchanted Beings</a>, and <a href="#ward-undead">Ward: Undead</a>. A PC will remember what happened to them while they were undead. While undead the PC should have the spellcaster’s best intentions in mind. A PC may be raised as undead if they are <a href="#disease">diseased</a>, but this does not cure them of the disease.</p>
<h3 id="walking-dead">Walking Dead</h3>
<p>The spells <a href="#beckon-corpse">Beckon Corpse</a> and <a href="#zombie-walk">Zombie Walk</a> enchant a corpse to walk without either returning them to life or being fully animated as undead. A corpse under these effects must move at a walking pace with their hands above their heads to their destination as dictated by the spell.</p>
<p>They should keep any items on them that they would retain if dragged, whether or not the items are stealable. If anyone directly interferes with their movement or attacks them, they fall to the ground and the effect ends. The Walking Dead cannot take any actions other than walking. They may not attack, search other bodies, cast spells, pick up objects, use magic items, drink potions, or perform any other action aside from movement. The effect does not stop regeneration or other methods of returning to life or becoming fully animated from occurring. Becoming alive or fully animated as undead ends the Walking Dead effect. Corpses under these effects are considered to be undead (see the <a href="#undead">Undead Caveat</a>).</p>
<h3 id="wards">Wards</h3>
<p>All Ward spells are also Chanting spells (see the <a href="#chanting">Chanting Caveat</a>). Ward spells affect a specific type of creature listed in the name of the Ward. When active, a Ward spell keeps the spellcaster from being attacked by creatures affected by that spell. A Ward spell affects creatures in front of the spellcaster, limited by a 180 degree hemisphere extending from shoulder to shoulder and outwards from the chest. The Ward will not keep the targeted creature(s) from walking around the spellcaster to attack others nearby. If the Ward affects them, the targeted creature(s) must stay approximately five feet away from the spellcaster, but need not retreat if the spellcaster advances upon them. To cast a Ward, the spellcaster must hold their spell focus out toward the targeted creatures while repeating the verbal. The verbal should make it clear what creatures are affected by the Ward. For example, “Stay back undead. Stay back undead. Stay back undead. Shoo,” would be an appropriate verbal for the <a href="#ward-undead">Ward: Undead</a> spell. This spell will work for as long as the spellcaster holds out the focus and keeps repeating the verbal. The people playing the targeted creatures must be able to hear what the spellcaster is saying, so it is up to the spellcaster to clearly and loudly chant their verbal. While casting this spell, the spellcaster may not attack the targeted creatures. A being that looks like it should be a targeted creature may not be (or may be immune to the Ward). It is still the responsibility of the spellcaster to take any and all weapon blows that hit them, even if the blows are from a creature they believe should be affected by the Ward.</p>
<h3 id="weapon-calls">Weapon Calls</h3>
<p>Each Weapon Call spell has a VC or AC which prepares the weapon with the special combat call, using a casting of the spell. The casting is spent if the blow lands an attack to a legal hit location. Otherwise, upon a parry or a miss, only the preparation is lost and the use remains. If you are unsure that the blow landed, you must assume that it did. The spellcaster cannot cast a different Weapon Call spell on a currently enchanted weapon until the first spell has been discharged. The spellcaster’s weapon may not be used by anyone else and still retain the enchanted status. If someone other than the spellcaster swings the prepared weapon, the preparation is lost, and must be reapplied.</p>
<h2 id="grandfathering">6.5: Grandfathering</h2>
<p>For the 2018 year only, all characters who were in existence (first attended an event) before February 25th, 2018 are allowed to have up to 15 spells, making a legal build following the rules of the current Omnibus. At the first event that their PC attends in the 2018 season where the Omnibus is available, they must get their spellbook checked in and signed by the Event Holder or their designated Magic Marshal(s). This signature counts for the signature requirements for all spells the PC grandfathers at this event.</p>
<p>All spells known after grandfathering may be added to the spellcaster’s “Spell Mastery” section, in addition to the list they had before grandfathering (if any).</p>

<h3 id="spell-descriptions">Spell Descriptions</h3>
<p><span id="animal-companion"><strong>Animal Companion</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p><strong>Uses:</strong> 1, and the spellcaster may only have one in-play - <strong>Material:</strong> A stuffed or toy animal that must be at least 4" tall - <strong>Caveats:</strong> <a href="#suspension">Suspension</a></p>
<p>The spellcaster has an animal companion represented by a specific stuffed or toy animal. The animal companion cannot be slain or disenchanted, but can be stolen. The stuffed animal must be labeled with the spellcaster’s name and the words “<a href="#event-stealable">Event-Stealable</a>.” The animal companion grants two separate abilities. The first ability is that the spellcaster may send their animal companion to gather information once per learning of the spell. The information gathered can only be relayed in a short sentence or concept, such as “the way ahead is blocked,” or “there are many foes,” etc. This ability is represented by the spellcaster giving their animal companion to the EH or MM and asking them a question. If the spellcaster asks for information that their animal companion is unable to obtain, they receive no answer.</p>
<p>The second ability that the animal companion grants is the ability to cast a single spell up to third circle, except the spell <a href="#implement">Implement</a>, which cannot be chosen. This spell will function as if it were learned normally, with the same requirements, limitations, number of castings, and components. While the animal companion is out gathering information the spells provided from the secondary ability are suspended.</p>
<p>Any additional spells provided by the animal companion require the animal companion to cast and maintain, as if the animal companion were a spell focus. Each spell must meet the requirement for verbal, material and active components. Spells with lasting effects (protections, immunities, etc.) can only be cast upon the spellcaster. Any blow that strikes the animal companion must be taken as if the animal companion is not there.</p>
<p>When the spellcaster first learns this spell, they choose their animal companion’s abilities. These abilities are not alterable from event to event. The spellcaster must list in their spellbook every spell their animal companion grants them as if they have learned the spell.</p>
<p>If they learn the spell additional times, the animal companion gets stronger. They may alter the abilities of their animal companion upon completion of each learning by giving it an additional spell and question. If the spellcaster unlearns a use of the spell, the animal companion becomes weaker and must be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p><span id="animate-lesser-undead"><strong>Animate Lesser Undead</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p><strong>Uses:</strong> 3 - <strong>Verbal:</strong> 30 words, and an explanation - <strong>Material:</strong> A tabard, or sash which clearly states “Undead,” “Skeleton,” “Ghost” or the like, or an appropriate mask - <strong>Caveats:</strong> <a href="#compulsion">Compulsion</a>, <a href="#undead">Undead</a></p>
<p>This spell creates a generic undead creature that will follow commands given by the spellcaster. It will only work on players; if cast on NPCs, they can refuse. If an NPC refuses a casting of the spell, the casting is not spent. To cast it, the spellcaster must get a corpse and recite the verbal while putting the sash or tabard over the corpse’s head, tabard-style, or while giving the corpse a mask to wear. If there is already an appropriate MC on the person, you may simply touch the recipient of the spell. The Lesser Undead is held at bay by <a href="#ward-undead">Ward: Undead</a> or <a href="#ward-enchanted-beings">Ward: Enchanted Beings</a>, cannot cross a <a href="#circle-of-protection">Circle of Protection</a>, and is killed in the normal fashion (no special protections are gained). It takes all blows and is killed in the normal fashion. It cannot use any armor or spells regardless of what the PC normally has. It will obey simple commands exactly, but will rebel if given any commands that violate the compulsion caveat. If left unattended, it will try to find the spellcaster that created it. If the target is not raised by the end of the event, they are considered dead and scalped. A character that is created as undead can be slain and raised or simply raised while undead to return to life.</p>
<p><span id="animate-undead"><strong>Animate Undead</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words, and an explanation - Material: A tabard, or sash which clearly states “Undead,” “Skeleton,” “Ghost” or the like, or an appropriate mask - Caveats: Compulsion, Undead</p>
<p>This spell, when cast upon a dead body, creates an undead creature that can use any spells or weapons that the target could normally. The undead is obviously not quite human, so it must either be made up to look a little odd, wear a mask, or wear a sash that clearly states that the person is some kind of undead creature. If this is already done you may simply touch the recipient of the spell as you say the verbal. What kind of creature is left up to the spellcaster, but it must definitely look slightly non-human. It does not allow a spellcaster to break their weapon restrictions. The undead must obey most direct commands given by the spellcaster, but is otherwise in full possession of their faculties. The only commands that an undead creature can ignore are ones that violate the compulsion caveat.</p>
<p>They are held at bay by Ward: Undead or Ward: Enchanted Beings, cannot cross a Circle of Protection, and are killed in the normal fashion (no special protections are gained). The target is considered to be undead until they are raised in a normal fashion. If Animate Lesser Undead is cast upon the target while the target is still undead, it will raise the target as if another Animate Undead spell were cast upon it, but the target’s loyalties transfer to the person who cast Animate Lesser Undead (no additional MC is needed). If a PC is still undead at the end of the event, that PC is considered dead and scalped. This spell will not work on a body without its scalp. A character that is created as undead can be slain and raised or simply raised while undead to return to life.</p>
<p><span id="animate-undead-general"><strong>Animate Undead General</strong> (5th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 40 words, and an explanation - Material: A tabard, or sash which clearly states “Undead,” “Skeleton,” “Ghost” or the like, or an appropriate mask, a written explanation of what this spell does, and you must supply them with 3 MCs for the Animate Lesser Undead spells they will cast. - Caveats: Compulsion, Undead</p>
<p>This spell, when cast upon a dead body, creates a greater undead creature that can use any spells or weapons that the target could normally. The undead is obviously not quite human, so it must either be made up to look a little odd, wear a mask, or wear a sash that clearly states that the person is some kind of undead creature. If this is already done you may simply touch the recipient of the spell as you say the verbal. What kind of creature is left up to the spellcaster, but it must definitely look slightly non-human. It does not allow a spellcaster to break their weapon restrictions. The undead must obey most direct commands given by the spellcaster, but is otherwise in full possession of their faculties. The only commands that an undead creature can ignore are ones that violate the compulsion caveat.</p>
<p>The Undead General is held at bay by Ward: Undead or Ward: Enchanted Beings, cannot cross a Circle of Protection, and is killed in the normal fashion (no special protections are gained). The Undead General is considered to be undead until they are raised in a normal fashion. If Animate Lesser Undead is cast upon the target while the target is still undead, it will raise the target as if another Animate Undead General spell were cast upon it, but the target’s loyalties transfer to the person who cast Animate Lesser Undead (an MC is needed). The Undead General will die to any magical attacks that damage it, regardless of location. If a PC is still undead at the end of the event, that PC is considered dead and scalped. This spell will not work on a body without its scalp. A character that is created as undead can be slain and raised or simply raised while undead to return to life. If a character under the effects of Embrace Death has this cast on them, it acts as the spell Animate Lesser Undead instead. You may have at most one undead general at a time.</p>
<p>In addition, the Undead General gains the ability to cast the spell Animate Lesser Undead with unlimited uses. An Undead General can only have 3 Lesser Undead at a time and must retrieve their MC before casting Animate Lesser Undead again. If the Undead General casts Animate Lesser Undead on anyone who is not under the effects of Embrace Death, they must use an MC.</p>
<p><span id="armor-piercing-weapon"><strong>Armor-Piercing Weapon</strong> (5th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 4 - Material: A cloth - Active: Wipe the entire length of the blade 5 times - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Weapon Calls</p>
<p>This spell gives the spellcaster the ability to enhance their weapon to pass through and destroy armor. After preparing the spell the spellcaster must call “Armor-Piercing” on the next swing of the weapon.</p>
<p><span id="armored-cloak"><strong>Armored Cloak</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 30 words - Material: A piece of garb with obvious runes or mystic symbols - Active: Lie on back while wearing the garment</p>
<p>This spell enchants a single piece of garb to provide one call of armor against an attack. It provides one point of armor against the next blow that lands upon the garment or any location at least 75% covered by the garment.</p>
<p>This Armored Cloak cannot be worn in combination with any other form of armor, ever. It can be worn while protected by a Protection from Missile or Resist Magic spell, in which case the wearer can choose to call either protection, saving the other for later. It can only be worn by the spellcaster, and cannot be cast on the same garment more than once. A specific piece of garb must be chosen for the MC at the beginning of the event, and cannot be changed during the course of the event without the EH’s permission.</p>
<p>For each additional learning above the first, you may select another, separate garment to enchant to share the single point. For instance, if you have taken the spell twice, you may choose to enchant a cloak and a shirt, however it only absorbs one blow on either hit location (not both). All garments must meet the requirements of the spell, and are all charged through a single casting of the spell.</p>
<p><span id="assassins-blade"><strong>Assassin’s Blade</strong> (6th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Material: A cloth, and either a single weapon up to 3’ long or an arrow, labeled with “Assassin’s Blade,” “Event-Stealable,” and the spellcaster’s name - Active: Wipe the entire length of the blade 5 times - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Weapon Calls</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to prepare their MC with the spells Armor-Piercing Weapon, Enchant Weapon, or Create Poison, without expending a casting, although a use of the spell must still remain in order to prepare it. To prepare the weapon with one of the listed spells, they must wipe the blade of the weapon with the cloth 5 times. Only one spell may be prepared at a time onto the Assassin’s Blade. Anyone may use the weapon, but only the spellcaster may utilize the special call with it. The weapon is one-handed, but may not be used in conjunction with another weapon or shield by the spellcaster. If the MC is IC broken, it will retain its magical properties if repaired.</p>
<p>In addition, any scalping blow dealt by an Assassin’s Blade counts as two blows dealt.</p>
<p><span id="aura-of-protection"><strong>Aura of Protection</strong> (2nd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, one at a time per learning - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active: Kneel or lie on back, no weapons in hand - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash</p>
<p>The recipient of this spell lessens the effect of the next hit they take from a call of “Magic,” “Silver,” “Disease,” “Armor-Piercing,” “Lightning Bolt,” or “Poison.” Rather than taking the effect they were hit with, the recipient of the spell takes the blow as a normal sword blow instead. It is necessary to call “Protection” when the spell activates.</p>
<p>When the spell is cast, the recipient of the spell must be kneeling or be lying on their back with no weapons in hand. This spell may be cast on a recipient other than the spellcaster; to do so the spellcaster must have no weapons in hand and touch the recipient while the spell is being cast. More than one casting of this spell may be in effect on a single PC. If the spellcaster casts this spell on another PC, they may not re-cast the spell until the sash is returned to them.</p>
<p><span id="beckon-corpse"><strong>Beckon Corpse</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words, repeated continuously, stating purpose of spell - Active: Spellcaster must be stationary until finished - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension, Undead, Walking Dead</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to summon a corpse to get up and move to them as the Walking Dead. The spellcaster must first get the attention of the player of said corpse and begin chanting the verbal. As long as the chanting continues, the corpse will get up and walk in the most direct (but OOC safe) path to the spellcaster as if under the effects of the spell Zombie Walk. If the corpse is interrupted, it will fall to the ground, but the spellcaster may finish the current round of the verbal, regain the corpse’s attention, and resume chanting the verbal to renew the effect on the corpse. The spell will end if the corpse reaches the spellcaster, the spellcaster stops chanting to do something else, or they move from where they are standing (although they may be moving their arms).</p>
<p>[<strong>Call the Soul</strong> (4th Circle){#call-the-soul}</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Five objects of equal size and shape, four of one color or design and one of a second color or design, and an opaque pouch or other way to keep them hidden - Active: A quest may be required</p>
<p>Allows the spellcaster to possibly find and reattach the soul of a scalped character. When cast, the spellcaster presents the pouch of objects to the scalped character, who must then reach in and take one without looking. If the object is one of the four, the soul is reattached. If the object is the second color or design, nothing happens.This spell must be cast in the presence of the MM, who may require an additional quest be completed.</p>
<p><span id="cantrip"><strong>Cantrip</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 3</p>
<p>Allows the spellcaster to gain one casting of any First Circle spell, chosen at the time of casting. The spell gained must be cast following the rules for that spell, including VC, MC, and ACs. This spell cannot be used with Implement.</p>
<p><span id="circle-of-healing"><strong>Circle of Healing</strong> (5th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 25 words - Material: 10-foot rope - Active: Touch the rope - Caveats: Circles, Suspension</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to create a Circle of Healing. The spellcaster may name the circle with Cure Disease, Heal Limb, or Raise Dead, chosen at the time of casting. Until the Circle of Healing is broken, the spellcaster need only stand in the circle, touch the recipient of the healing spell, and recite the named spell’s VC to cast the spell. This does not use up any castings of the named healing spell, and can be done as many times as desired. No one but the spellcaster may use the Circle of Healing in this manner. This spell is broken if a weapon crosses the plane of the circle. For this purpose, a weapon is considered to be anything with a legal striking surface - therefore, swords and arrows are weapons, although bows and shields are not.</p>
<p><span id="circle-of-protection"><strong>Circle of Protection</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 10 words - Material: 15-foot white rope, or less - Caveats: Circles, Suspension, Enchanted Beings</p>
<p>This spell creates a barrier that no enchanted being can physically pass, affect, or attack, with the exception of the spellcaster that cast it. In addition, no magic of any kind can pass through the barrier in either direction, again with the exception of the spellcaster that cast the spell. The spellcaster that cast the circle may pass over the barrier freely and may cast spells through the barrier at will.</p>
<p>A single spellcaster with multiple castings, or several different spellcasters, can combine Circle of Protection spells to make a larger one. If multiple spellcasters join their circles together, the result is a larger circle, but no enchanted being (even the spellcasters that created it) may pass in or out of the circle, and no magic of any kind (even from the spellcasters that created it) can pass through the barrier in either direction. Magic can be cast inside the circle as normal, but all the effects remain within the circle.</p>
<p>The spellcaster may decide to break their own circle whenever they choose by uncrossing the rope. The spellcaster can do this even if the circle was cast with other spellcasters.</p>
<p><span id="combat-raise-dead"><strong>Combat Raise Dead</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: 3 words - Active: Must touch recipient of spell</p>
<p>This spell will raise a dead character, healing all of their injured limbs. The VC must clearly state the effects of the spell. For example, “Rise and fight” is a VC that would make it clear that the individual is being raised.</p>
<p><span id="commune-with-spirit"><strong>Commune with Spirit</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Active: Ritual - it is required that the spellcaster not actively seek out the MM or EH. The ritual must, in effect, be spectacular enough that the EH or MM comes of their own volition.</p>
<p>Allows the spellcaster to gain a boon of insight/wisdom from the EH. This spell allows the spellcaster to ask a spirit something relating to the plot of the event. How detailed the response or how lengthy the conversation is with the spirit, is determined completely by the spirit. It should be noted that the spirit does not have to answer the call of the spellcaster, and that sometimes instead of helping solve a problem, may give the spellcaster an awareness of more problems that need solving.</p>
<p><span id="create-poison"><strong>Create Poison</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 6 - Material: Disposable edible or drinkable component - Caveats: Potions, Enchanted Items, Combat Calls, Compulsion</p>
<p>This spell creates one dose of a specific kind of poison per use. There are only four types of poison created by this spell: Death, Love, Sleep, and Truth.</p>
<p>Death kills instantly. Love makes the victim fall in love with the first person they see for the next 10 minutes. Sleep causes the victim to fall into a deep sleep for 10 minutes. They cannot be woken before this time passes. Truth causes the victim to be unable to speak anything except the truth for 10 minutes, but does not force them to talk. The type of poison must be chosen when it is cast, and each individual effect listed in the spellcaster’s spellbook. The poison must be ingested and cannot affect those who don’t eat or drink it. This effect must be written legibly on a scroll. This scroll is to be given to the victim by the spellcaster or MM immediately after the MC has been consumed. Only one dose may be made per use, and only the first person to ingest part of the MC is affected by a spell. The spell is always rendered inert by Immunity to Poison. While the poison may have the intended effect to alter how someone may act, such as a love potion, it may in no way be used to compel any player to act in what they consider an immoral or unethical fashion. A person who ingests a love poison always has the option of allowing their PC to die if they are OOC uncomfortable with the situation. In any case, you should talk with the EH or MM if the use of any poison bothers you.</p>
<p>Alternatively the caster may expend a use of the spell to coat a weapon with deadly poison. The next time the caster swings the weapon they must call “Poison.” To use this spell this way, the MC becomes a cloth, and the AC becomes wipe the length of the blade 5 times with the MC.</p>
<p><span id="cry-of-life"><strong>Cry of Life</strong> (6th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: “All in the sound of my voice, rise and fight.”</p>
<p>This spell instantly raises all dead characters whose players hear the verbal. The spell affects all who hear it, including NPCs and characters fighting against the spellcaster.</p>
<p><span id="cure-disease"><strong>Cure Disease</strong> (1st Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Disposable</p>
<p>This spell will cure the recipient of all diseases that are currently affecting them. It will not provide protection from catching a disease after the spell is cast.</p>
<p><span id="death-watch"><strong>Death Watch</strong> (2nd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Active: Spellcaster must sit without weapons in-hand for 60 seconds before they are killed. Each time the spellcaster is killed, they need to re-cast the spell.</p>
<p>Enables the spellcaster to see and hear while they are dead. You may not speak or move while dead, except for addressing marshaling calls or OOC unsafe/uncomfortable situations. If the spellcaster is scalped, all memories acquired through the current casting of Death Watch are erased (i.e., all memories acquired from the time of your PC’s last death).</p>
<p><span id="death-wish"><strong>Death Wish</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words, and an explanation - Material: A scroll containing the trigger phrase and command Caveats: Compulsion</p>
<p>This spell, when cast upon a dead body, implants a simple command into their mind. The spellcaster must give the target player the scroll after completing the verbal. The target should read the scroll and may refer to it at any time. However, the scroll and the information it contains are OOC, and are not known to the PC in any way. When the target character is alive, and hears the trigger phrase, they must perform the command to the best of their ability. The spell ends when the target successfully completes the command, or is slain trying. The target may ignore any commands that violate the compulsions caveat.</p>
<p>This spell will not work on a body without its scalp. The spell Protect the Soul negates all effects of this spell.</p>
<p><span id="deep-pockets"><strong>Deep Pockets</strong> (2nd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Material: A bag no larger than 6" by 12" by 3"</p>
<p>Each casting allows spellcaster to deny any stealable items that are completely within the MC to the next three characters that search the spellcaster, while that bag is on the spellcaster’s body. If the spellcaster is not carrying any stealable items outside of the bag, they may answer, “Nothing.” All other stealable items must be yielded to a search. Each additional learning of this spell allows the spellcaster an additional 6" by 12" by 3" volume of bag, either as a separate bag, or a larger bag. However, the spellcaster can only have one usage cast at a time. Each search denial is used up on all of the volumes simultaneously. One Deep Pockets bag may never contain another. No matter how many Deep Pockets castings are combined it does not combine the amount of people that need to search it; it only increases the size of the bag.</p>
<p><span id="detect-magic"><strong>Detect Magic</strong> (1st Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to take any one item (not a living or dead creature) to the EH or MM to ask whether casting Identify upon the object will yield any information the spellcaster cannot determine by looking at it, such as “It’s a stick,” or “It’s a sword.” It may be cast on a living or dead being to detect a magical item it carries, such as a spell focus or magic weapon. In this case, it will not tell what the item does, only that it is there and which item it is. If cast in this manner multiple times and there are multiple magical items, it will not repeat magic items until there are no new items to reveal.</p>
<p><span id="disease-weapon"><strong>Disease Weapon</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spellcaster’s weapon - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Weapon Calls</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to temporarily enchant their weapon. After preparing it with the spell, it is considered a diseased weapon and the spellcaster must call “Disease” on the next swing of the weapon.</p>
<p><span id="disenchant"><strong>Disenchant</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Active: Touch the target item</p>
<p>This spell will remove enchantments from the target item. If the target item is a potion, panacea, or scroll, it will be rendered inert. If the target is a magic weapon it will no longer function as such until repaired by a Reforge spell. If the target is a Spell Sash, then the spell represented by the Sash is ended. Circle of Protection, Light, and other pure spells are not affected unless otherwise stated in their description. Only items specified by the EH are immune to this spell.</p>
<p><span id="disrupt"><strong>Disrupt</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 30 words, starting with “I disrupt this (spell name) …” - Active: Clearly point at the target - Caveats: Suspension</p>
<p>This spell will suspend any circle or chanting spell (see Circles and Chanting Caveats). It may only be cast upon a spell that is currently in use. Once the spellcaster completes the disruption, the target spell is suspended for five minutes and the spellcaster of the target spell loses the ability to cast the target spell for five minutes. If the target spell ends before the disruption is completed (the spellcaster stops chanting, the circle is broken, etc.), the spellcaster of that spell still loses the ability to cast that spell for five minutes. This spell only stops the current learning of the target spell. Therefore, if the spellcaster has taken Ward: Enchanted Beings twice, they temporarily lose the ability to cast one, but retain the ability to cast the other.</p>
<p><span id="disrupt-light"><strong>Disrupt Light</strong> (1st Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words, which must clearly state the effect of the spell</p>
<p>This spell cancels Light spells cast by other spellcasters. Once the Disrupt Light spellcaster is within sight and hearing of a Light spellcaster, they may loudly call out their verbal. Upon completion of the verbal, all other spellcasters within hearing range must put away their active Light spells. This action is OOC, and those affected must do so even if they hear the spell while dead. Spellcasters so affected cannot recast the Light spell for five minutes, after which time they may reuse the same chemical light sticks.</p>
<p><span id="divine-aid"><strong>Divine Aid</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: Speak to EH - Material: A sacrifice may be required - Active: A quest may be required</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to send a request for aid to a higher power. The request cannot be specific and the higher power may send whatever aid they see fit. This spell comes with no guarantee that the EH won’t simply listen to the request and say “No.” This spell cannot create an effect that will last beyond the end of the event, other than for healing purposes. A spellcaster who uses drama and theatrics has a better chance of success.</p>
<p><span id="embrace-death"><strong>Embrace Death</strong> (6th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 40 words - Material: A container at least 4 inches in diameter able to hold the spellcaster’s scalp token. The container cannot be placed into Deep Pockets. - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Regeneration, Basic Regeneration, Undead</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to remove their soul from their body, giving them the ability to defy death. The spellcaster’s scalp token is the only thing which may be stored in the MC (hereafter referred to as the phylactery). When the spell is learned, the spellcaster must scribe in their spellbook a description of exactly what the phylactery looks like. Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster places their scalp token within the phylactery, which becomes an event-stealable item for the duration of the spell and should be marked as such. The spellcaster may do whatever they want with the phylactery: place it in a mundane pocket, hide it, give it to someone, etc. However, the phylactery may not be put into Deep Pockets.</p>
<p>While under the effects of this spell, the spellcaster is undead (see the Undead Caveat) and is not affected by poisons, diseases, or the spells Call the Soul, Cry of Life, Heal Limb, Potion of Combat Raise Dead, Potion of Heal Limb, Regenerate the Scalp, Regeneration, and Seed of Life. Additionally, the spells Raise Dead and Combat Raise Dead will only affect the spellcaster if the character casting these spells is touching the phylactery. Being raised in this manner returns the spellcaster to undeath and repairs all of their damaged limbs.</p>
<p>While this spell is active, the spellcaster’s limbs may be regenerated by remaining stationary for 30 seconds. The spells Animate Undead, Animate Undead General, and Animate Lesser Undead, as well as Potion of Animate Lesser Undead and Potion of Animate Undead from the spell Strange Brew, will return the spellcaster to undeath (repairing any damaged limbs), without placing the spellcaster into someone else’s control. While in possession of the phylactery, the spellcaster may enchant themselves to regenerate (as described below) by sitting without weapons in hand and incanting the VC. This grants a basic regeneration that will return the spellcaster to undeath the next time they die. If the spellcaster is killed with magic, the regeneration time will double to 240 seconds. Once returned to undeath the spellcaster must re-enchant themselves as described above, before they will regenerate again in this manner.</p>
<p>Scalping will prevent the spellcaster from regenerating, but they may still be returned to undeath by any other means described previously. The spellcaster does not hand over their scalp token when scalped while under the effects of this spell.</p>
<p>The spellcaster may end this spell at any time by opening the phylactery, returning the soul to their body. If the phylactery is disenchanted (by use of the Disenchant spell or a Potion of Disenchant), the spell is forcibly ended, and the spellcaster is slain and considered scalped. If the spell is not ended before the end of the event, the spellcaster is considered dead and scalped.</p>
<p><span id="enchant-armor"><strong>Enchant Armor</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words and an explanation - Material: A non-stealable token with the spellcaster’s name and the words “Enchant Armor” on it - Caveats: Enchanted Items</p>
<p>This spell enchants armor worn by one person that the spellcaster may continually repair without expending other spells. When the spellcaster enchants the armor they give the token to the person that will be wearing it. The person wearing the armor must have the token on themselves at all times while the spell is in effect. Once this spell is cast on armor that a character is wearing, it remains enchanted until the token is disenchanted or the spell ends. As long as the person with the armor has the token, and the armor is still enchanted, the spellcaster may cast Repair Armor as an unlimited effect on the armor by performing that spell’s AC on the enchanted armor. This spell does not require the caster to currently have the spell Repair Armor or have any remaining castings of Repair Armor in order to use this effect.</p>
<p><span id="enchant-weapon"><strong>Enchant Weapon</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 10 words - Active: Hold the target weapon with both hands - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items</p>
<p>This spell gives the spellcaster the ability to temporarily enchant a weapon or bow. After preparing it with the spell, the weapon user must call “Magic” or “Silver” the next 3 times they swing that weapon or fire that bow. The caster chooses which option, Magic or Silver, upon casting the spell, and must inform the recipient which option they are imbuing it with. These calls are expended whether the user scores a successful hit or not.</p>
<p><span id="enfeeble-being"><strong>Enfeeble Being</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words, starting with “I declare you mundane …”</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to remove the special powers and abilities from a single NPC creature. To cast the spell, the spellcaster must get the creature’s attention and begin the verbal. Once the spell is completed, the target loses all special powers and abilities. This includes natural armor, spells, regeneration, etc. Because this is a relatively low-circle spell, it will probably not affect more powerful creatures, such as unique enemies or the proverbial “Big Bad Guy,” but it might work on things like a troll, a lesser demon, or a goblin shaman. This spell will never work on PCs. A spellcaster should choose their targets wisely.</p>
<p><span id="familiar"><strong>Familiar</strong> (5th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1. The spellcaster may only have one in-play - Material: A stuffed or toy animal that must be at least 4" tall - Caveats: Suspension</p>
<p>The spellcaster has a familiar that grants them more spell potential, represented by a specific stuffed or toy animal. The familiar cannot be slain or disenchanted, but can be stolen. The stuffed animal must be labeled with the spellcaster’s name and the words “Event-Stealable.”</p>
<p>Any additional spells provided by the familiar require the presence of the familiar to cast it and maintain it, as if the familiar were a spell focus or additional MC. If the familiar is stolen or dropped, the spellcaster may not cast or maintain any of the extra spells. Each spell must meet the requirement for VC, MC, and ACs. Spells with lasting effects (protections, immunities, etc.) can only be cast upon the spellcaster. Spells with lasting effects are suspended while the familiar is not in the spellcaster’s possession. Any blow that strikes the familiar must be taken as if the familiar is not there.</p>
<p>The spellcaster has 5 points to spend on extra spells for every casting of this spell, up to 15 points total.</p>
<p>Benefit</p>
<p>Cost</p>
<p>Raise Dead</p>
<p>(1 pt.) - 1 use</p>
<p>Disrupt</p>
<p>(1 pt.) - 1 use</p>
<p>Call The Soul</p>
<p>(2 pts.) - 1 use</p>
<p>Enfeeble Being</p>
<p>(2 pts.) - 1 use</p>
<p>Find The Path</p>
<p>(2 pts.) - 1 use</p>
<p>Shapeshifting</p>
<p>(2 pts.) - 1 use</p>
<p>Combat Raise Dead</p>
<p>(3 pts.) - 2 uses</p>
<p>Reforge: Restore Enchantment</p>
<p>(4 pts.) - 1 use</p>
<p>When the spellcaster first casts this spell, they choose their familiar’s abilities. These abilities are not alterable from event to event. The spellcaster must list every spell their familiar grants them in their spellbook as if they have learned the spell.</p>
<p>If they learn the spell Familiar a second (or third) time, they may alter the abilities of their familiar upon completion of each learning. If the spellcaster unlearns a use of the spell Familiar, the familiar they have then becomes weaker and must be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p><span id="feign-death"><strong>Feign Death</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited - Material: A cloth - Active: Wipe cloth over face 5 times</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to disguise themselves so as to appear dead. If someone asks them if they are dead they can legally answer “Yes,” and may lie down or sit with their sword or arm above their head as to appear dead (see Section 3.4: Character Death and Section 3.5: Scalping). Feign Death ends once the spellcaster moves or speaks (except for addressing marshaling calls or OOC uncomfortable/unsafe situations). If a person moves them, thinking they are dead, the Feign Death does not end; only when they move themselves. If struck while using Feign Death, the spellcaster is still affected by the blow as normal.</p>
<p><span id="fighters-intuition"><strong>Fighter’s Intuition</strong> (1st Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Material: Spell Sash - Active: place sash on fighter - Caveats: Spell Sash</p>
<p>This spell must be cast on a non-spellcaster by placing the sash on the fighter and giving an explanation of how it works. This does not make the fighter an enchanted being.</p>
<p>This fighter may now call out “Fighter’s Intuition” once. When the fighter does this, they may or may not learn information about a monster they can see. It is up to the event staff to decide to provide this information or not. The information can be anything: weakness, methods of defeating, or even what the NPC likes to eat.</p>
<p><span id="find-the-path"><strong>Find the Path</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words - Caveats: Spell Failure</p>
<p>This spell provides the spellcaster a route to find, locate, or travel to a person, place or thing that they know by name. For instance, you can get a response from “Where is the body of King Joe?” but not from “Take me to the person who stole my sword.” The results of this spell can come as a guide, a map, a set of directions, a divining rod, or any other mechanic that the EH or MM deems appropriate. Be aware that the answer may not always be the safest or shortest path. This spell will fail if an answer cannot be determined because of PC action.</p>
<p><span id="foretell"><strong>Foretell</strong> (4th Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: A prediction that the EH/MM must be present for</p>
<p>Allows the spellcaster to make a prediction of an event to come, ie. “Sir Thomas will slay a dragon with a silver sword.” If the event foretold comes to pass the EH/MM may grant a boon to the spellcaster or anyone involved in the prediction. The nature and power of this boon is up to the EH/MM. The greater the foretold event or more specific the prediction, the more powerful the resulting boon should be.</p>
<p><span id="fortune-tell"><strong>Fortune Tell</strong> (3rd Circle)</span></p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Material: Fortune-telling paraphernalia, such as runes or a tarot deck</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to ask a question of the EH or MM, which will be answered in a symbolic manner. How much information (if any) and the form in which it is given is at the discretion of the EH or MM. As this is a relatively low-circle spell, no proper names may be used in either the question or the answer for this spell. For example, while a spellcaster cannot ask “Who killed Sir Schlep?” they can ask, “Who killed this knight?” and the answer can be “Tarot Card: Jack of Wands” but not “Bad Bart.” This spell can only be used to determine information that is plot-related. If the EH or MM does not know the answer because the question asked relates to PC actions, an answer will not be given but the spell is still used. If the spell is cast and an answer cannot be given because of any of the above limitations, the casting is still used up.</p>
<p>Ghost Blade (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: A white ribbon with the words “Ghost Blade” on it - Caveats: Enchanted Items</p>
<p>This spell enchants a single weapon to no longer affect the casting of the spells Raise Dead or Regeneration or the breaking of Circle of Healing. Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster must tie the MC onto the enchanted weapon.</p>
<p>Group Healing (2nd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 10 words - Material: 30’ rope - Active: Touch the rope - Caveats: Circles</p>
<p>This spells allows the spellcaster to cast an enchanted circle. This circle allows certain spells cast into it to affect all the people within the circle. The Group Healing circle may be used to enhance the power of the following spells: Combat Raise Dead, Cure Disease, Immunity to Poison, Heal Limb, and Raise Dead. Multiple castings of Group Healing from the same or different spellcasters may be used at the same time, creating a bigger circle.</p>
<p>To enchant the Group Healing circle, lay the rope(s) in a circle on the ground with the ends touching. Then all the characters to be cast upon should be gathered into the circle. The spellcaster(s) must then recite the VC, which empowers the circle.</p>
<p>The next spell from the accepted list cast into this circle by any spellcaster affects all within as if it had been cast on each individually; in most cases any MC is only used once. The Immunity to Poison spell still requires the necessary components to cast for each character affected.</p>
<p>Guidance (2nd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Material: Divining paraphernalia to indicate a yes/no answer</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to ask the EH or MM a yes/no question. If the EH or MM does not know the answer because the question asked relates to PC actions, an answer may not be given but the spell is still used. An answer will be given in the form of “Yes” or “No” by the EH or MM. If the spell is cast and an answer cannot be given because of any of the above limitations, the casting is still used up.</p>
<p>Heal Limb (2nd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 20 words - Active: Spellcaster must be stationary, must touch the target limb</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to heal one damaged limb at a time. The spellcaster must recite the VC while touching the recipient’s injured limb. The spellcaster cannot move their feet while casting this spell, although they may be moving their arms (e.g., parrying, so long as they don’t step backwards).</p>
<p>Heartiness (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, one at a time</p>
<p>Having this spell makes the spellcaster harder to scalp. The next time the spellcaster is scalped it will take 200 extra blows to successfully scalp them. If scalped for only 200 blows, instead of the full 400 blows, the spellcaster must inform the scalper that “The job is not yet done.” A spellcaster can only be under the effect of one Heartiness spell at a time. A use is considered to be over whenever the spellcaster receives at least 200 scalping blows, but is in effect until they are either fully scalped or raised.</p>
<p>Identify (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: 30 words</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to take any one item (not a living/dead creature) to the EH or MM to ask what it is and expect an answer. This spell can also determine what race an unknown creature is. If the spellcaster can successfully reach visual inspection range, recite the verbal, and the creature is not hostile, it must state what race it is. The response is not IC speech by the creature, and it can answer while dead.</p>
<p>Immunity to Poison (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Disposable</p>
<p>This spell makes the recipient immune to the next dose of poison that would have otherwise affected their PC during the event. When damaged by the next poison attack, whether ingested or delivered by a poisoned weapon, call “Immunity to Poison!” Only one Immunity to Poison is used at a time. The recipient must take any mundane damage from a poisoned weapon regardless of whether they are protected from the actual poison. The recipient should be given the MC when the spell is cast, and they should dispose of it when the immunity has been used. More than one Immunity to Poison can be cast upon a recipient; the effect is stackable. The MC of the spell is not stealable or transferable after it is cast. This spell can also be cast as an antidote for any one poison that the recipient has been subjected to, but in this case it will not provide any further protection.</p>
<p>Implement (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Special - Material: Safe, non-weapon Staff (between 4’ and 6’ long, inclusive), Wand (between 12" and 18" long, inclusive), Orb (at least 4" in diameter), or Book (bound, minimum 1/2" x 4" x 7", cannot be the spellcaster’s spell-book)</p>
<p>The spellcaster is able to create a staff, wand, orb, or book (hereafter called “implement”) that enhances their own spells. Each time the spellcaster learns this spell, they gain 1 point into a pool from which they may purchase special abilities from the following choices below. A spellcaster may only have 5 points worth of implements per event. At the magic check-in of an event, the spellcaster may choose how the points in their pool are spent.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, abilities gained that augment or alter spells require that the spellcaster already knows that spell, otherwise there is no effect. In order to use the gained ability, the spellcaster must be holding the implement in one hand.</p>
<p>The implement is a magical manifestation and cannot be broken. Any blow that strikes the implement must be taken as if the implement is not there. You can not actively parry with an implement.</p>
<p>An implement may be disenchanted causing any effects or castings to be lost until the implement is restored. If disenchanted it takes 200 seconds of holding the implement with both hands and nothing else to restore.</p>
<p>Gain one additional casting of one of the following spells for 1 point each: Find the Path, Fortune Tell, Guidance, Precognition, Skew Divination, Raise Dead, Deep Pockets, Enfeeble Being, Beckon Corpse, Disenchant, or Disrupt.</p>
<p>Gain the following abilities for 1 point each:</p>
<p>The AC for Armored Cloak is changed to “Kneel on one knee while holding their implement with both hands.” When using a Circle spell you may double the length of the rope. This may only be done once. The AC for Death Watch is changed to “Spellcaster must kneel on one knee holding their Implement with both hands for 60 seconds before being killed.” The requirement for recasting the spell is also removed. The spell Death Watch allows the caster to move their head while dead. They still may not speak, try to communicate, or move in any other way while dead.</p>
<p>Gain one additional casting of one of the following spells for 2 points each: Call the Soul, Group Healing, Resist Magic, Animate Undead, or Soul Bane.</p>
<p>Gain the following abilities for 2 points each:</p>
<p>The uses for Speak become unlimited. Gain 1 point to spend on your familiar. This ability may not be taken more than once. When this augmentation is first used through Implement, you shall list an alternate build for the familiar. This alternate build can only be changed by learning or unlearning a use of Familiar. From now on, when you use your familiar and it is augmented by Implement, it uses that new build. If you are using the augmented build, and you do not have your implement on you, you may not use your Familiar abilities.</p>
<p>Gain one additional casting of one of the following spells for 3 points each: Vision or Séance.</p>
<p>Gain the following abilities for 3 points each:</p>
<p>Gain one use of Regeneration. You are not required to know the spell to use this ability. Gain one use of Regeneration. Upon completion, the spellcaster will be raised as a free-willed undead. You are not required to know the spell to use this ability. Gain one additional Magic Missile prop. Intervention (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: Speak to EH - Material: A sacrifice may be required - Active: A quest may be required</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to go to the EH and ask a boon from whatever powers their magic. It should be cast in the presence of the EH or MM. It is to be used to request favors such as: “Oh, please, great majestic god/Fire Spirit/Navel Lint, grant me a quest to search for the lost scalp of my overlord, Sir Biff of Bonehead Ridge.” This spell comes with no guarantee that the EH won’t simply listen to the request and say “No.” This spell cannot create an effect that will last beyond the end of the event, other than for healing purposes. A spellcaster who uses drama and theatrics has a better chance of success, and simple, small requests are also more likely to be granted. Any requests that will unbalance the game will likely be either denied straight out, or assigned an unsolvable quest.</p>
<p>Light (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 3 syllables - Material: Chemical light stick and dark bag - Active: Snap and shake the stick</p>
<p>This spell creates light. The spellcaster may use as many light sticks as desired. They must also carry a bag large enough to hold all of the glow sticks they will use and thick enough to prevent any light from escaping. The bag is to be used if they are affected by a Disrupt Light spell. The spellcaster may not give a glow stick to anyone who is going to travel beyond easy speaking distance. It is possible for this spell to be disrupted. It is the spellcaster’s responsibility to know what the Disrupt Light spell is, how to recognize it, and how to respond to it. It is a first circle spell.</p>
<p>Lightning Bolt (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 prop, unlimited use - Verbal: “Lightning Bolt” - Material: 1 white boff arrow or javelin prop between 2’6" and 3’6" long - Caveats: Combat Calls</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to throw a stronger bolt of magic than Magic Missile. The MC for the spell is a golf tube, aqua tube, or T8 fluorescent light cover arrow or javelin prop made following the Weapon Construction rules for arrows and javelins with the following additions:</p>
<p>The prop must be primarily white. The prop must be between 2’6" and 3’6" in length and cannot have an arrow nock. The prop is not subject to the spellcaster’s weapon length restriction. The prop must have the words “Lightning Bolt” and the spellcaster’s name written visibly along the shaft.</p>
<p>The prop is a physical representation of the magic. After it comes to rest, it cannot be affected or moved by anyone other than the spellcaster, but it may still be seen or guarded by anybody. The prop counts as a hand-and-a-half weapon and must be thrown, not shot from a bow. The prop, including its shaft, strikes as an armor-piercing magic blow to anything it makes contact with, until it comes to rest. Once cast, it cannot be cast again until the spellcaster recovers the prop. The prop is not considered a weapon and does not cause Spell Failure, except while the spell is active (i.e. from when the prop is thrown until it comes to rest).</p>
<p>Magic Missile (4th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, while spellcaster has MC handy - Verbal: “Magic Missile” - Material: 2 beanbags or foam &amp; duct tape blocks, about 3" diameter - Caveats: Combat Calls</p>
<p>When thrown, this spell strikes whatever it hits as if it were a magic sword. It will damage every location it hits, until it comes to rest. The prop is a physical representation of the magic. After it comes to rest, it cannot be affected or moved by anyone other than the spellcaster, but it may still be seen or guarded by anybody. A magic missile MC can be thrown with one hand. When a MC is being thrown, the other hand may contain only a single magic missile MC or a single-handed weapon or shield, and does not count toward dual-wielding for the purposes of weapon restrictions. The prop is not considered a weapon and does not cause Spell Failure except while the spell is active (i.e. from when the prop is thrown until it comes to rest). The spellcaster may only throw their spell props, and may not pick up those thrown by another spellcaster.</p>
<p>Masterwork Hammer (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 50 words - Material: A boff hammer up to 3’ in length with “Event-Stealable,” “Masterwork Hammer,” and the spellcaster’s name written on it - Active: Special - Caveats: Enchanted Items</p>
<p>This spell creates a Masterwork Hammer which swings magic. The hammer may also be used to repair non-armor, non-magic items (bows, weapons, shields) in 30 seconds. The hammer may also repair all armor on a target player to 1 pt., using the hammer as the focus of the spell, in 30 seconds. While using the hammer to make any type of repair the spellcaster must remain stationary and should actively use the hammer to simulate repairing the target. If the hammer is broken the spellcaster may repair it by holding the item in both hands and reciting the verbal. Only the spellcaster may use any of the benefits of this spell.</p>
<p>Mystic Forge (4th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 25 words - Material: 10-foot rope - Active: Touch the rope - Caveats: Circles, Suspension</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to create a Mystic Forge. The spellcaster may name the circle with Enchant Weapon or Repair Item, chosen at the time of casting. Until the Mystic Forge is broken, the spellcaster need only stand in the circle, touch the target item, and recite the named spell’s VC to cast the spell. This does not use up any castings of the named spell, and this can be done as many times as desired. No one but the spellcaster may use the Mystic Forge in this manner.</p>
<p>Pas (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: Pas, friend… - Material: Food, coin, or some offering - Active: Offer the MC to the target - Caveats: Compulsion</p>
<p>This spell creates an uneasy, temporary truce between the target and the PC. To cast this spell the spellcaster offers something of value to the target and says something along the lines of, “Pas, friend orc, and accept these shiny bits to let me pass unharmed.” If the target accepts the offering, they are magically bound to not attack the spellcaster for 60 seconds unless the target is attacked. If the target is attacked or the spellcaster is slain this spell ends immediately. Protect the Soul will block the effects of this spell as will Resist Magic.</p>
<p>Precognition (3rd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Material: Divining paraphernalia (such as a crystal ball or mirror)</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to gain non-specified information about the plot from the EH or MM. How much information (if any) is at the discretion of the EH or MM. One casting of Precognition may be pre-registered and the results of this spell will be presented to the spellcaster at check-in for the event. If a precognition is not given at the beginning of the event, the casting is not used.</p>
<p>Prophecy (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Active: Ritual (Optional)</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to ask the EH or MM a question pertaining to the plot of the event. The EH or MM will give the spellcaster as complete an answer as they are willing. The method of delivering this knowledge is at the EH or MM’s discretion. A spellcaster may use drama, theatrics, or sacrifice during the ritual to have a better chance of gaining information. After casting this spell, the EH or MM may choose to release additional information to the spellcaster at any time during the remainder of the event or until a spell reset.</p>
<p>Protect Item (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Ribbon tied onto the item protected. Remove the ribbon soon after the spell is expended/used to protect the item - Caveats: Enchanted Items</p>
<p>This spell allows a single non-armor item to be protected from the next attack that would normally damage it. For example, a protected sword struck by a boulder would not be destroyed, but the wielder would still suffer normal damage (e.g., death usually). The call for this spell is “Protect Item.” A particular item may only have one casting of Protect Item on it at a time. This spell does not protect against Disenchant.</p>
<p>Protect the Soul (3rd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words and an explanation - Material: Spell Sash - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash</p>
<p>This spell will protect the recipient from possession, Animate Undead, and the like. When targeted by any spell or effect against which Protect the Soul immunizes your PC, you must call “Protect the Soul!” The spell will last until the sash is disenchanted or removed by the spellcaster. The spell will not function if the recipient is scalped or their soul is not within their body for any other reason.</p>
<p>Protection from Boulder (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 20 words - Material: Spell Sash - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash</p>
<p>The spellcaster is protected from the next “boulder” call that strikes them. This protection extends to all equipment they are carrying.</p>
<p>Protection from Missile (2nd Circle) Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spell Sash - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash - Active: Kneel or lie on back, no weapons in hand</p>
<p>The recipient of this spell is protected from the next hit they take from an arrow, javelin, or Magic Missile spell. It is necessary to call “Protection” when the spell activates. This spell will also protect equipment (such as armor) that would otherwise be affected by the missile.</p>
<p>When the spell is cast, the recipient of the spell must be kneeling or be lying on their back with no weapons in hand. This spell may be cast on a recipient other than the spellcaster; to do so the spellcaster must have no weapons in hand and touch the recipient while the spell is being cast. More than one casting of this spell may be in effect on a single PC. If the spellcaster casts this spell on another PC, they may not re-cast the spell until the sash is returned to them.</p>
<p>Purity to Disease (3rd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1, Self-only - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active: Lie on back, no weapons in hand - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Spell Sash</p>
<p>Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster becomes completely immune to the effects of diseases.</p>
<p>Purity to Poison (3rd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1, Self-only - Verbal: 10 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active: Lie on back, no weapons in hand - Caveats: Combat Calls, Enchanted Items, Spell Sash</p>
<p>Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster becomes completely immune to the effects of poisons.</p>
<p>Raise Dead (3rd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 30 words - Active: Spellcaster must be within 2 feet of corpse and there can be no weapons within 10 feet of the spellcaster - Caveats: Spell Failure</p>
<p>This spell will raise a dead character, healing all of their injured limbs. There can be no weapons within 10 feet of the spellcaster at any point while casting this spell, or the spell will fail to work. For this purpose, a weapon is considered to be anything with a legal striking surface - swords and arrows are weapons, although bows are not. The player of the character being raised must be present to represent the corpse. No proxy can be used for the corpse.</p>
<p>Reforge (5th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Special - Active: Special</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to reforge an existing item, either improving it or repairing a magical item. The spellcaster may choose one of the following options when casting the spell. Each option has its own effects and requirements for casting the spell that must be met for the spell to be successfully cast.</p>
<p>Silver Weapon: this option will allow the spellcaster to create a permanent silver weapon. This option has an additional MC of the weapon’s weight in silver coins (plain aluminum roofing tins, aluminum “Coin of the Realm,” etc.).The spellcaster must write the words “Silver” and “Stealable” on the blade of the weapon. The spellcaster should also write “Silvered by” and the spellcaster’s name on the blade. All of the silver that is collected for the casting of this spell must be handed over to the EH. All silver weapons are stealable, and the spellcaster must explain to anyone having a weapon made silver that it will be stealable, and will be considered property of the Realms, to be passed back and forth within the game as a searchable item, for as long as it is silver. A silver weapon will lose the quality of being silver if the writing on the blade fades to the point of no longer being readable or if the weapon is OOC or IC broken (such as by a boulder). Players may not protect the writing in any way and may not rewrite it. A silvered weapon broken IC (i.e., by any means other than the fading of the writing or the physical destruction of the prop) can be repaired by an expenditure of this spell, without having to provide the necessary silver. Repairing a weapon in this way does not allow you to remake the prop or rewrite the word “Silver” on the weapon. Silver Weapon will not allow you to silver an existing magic item.</p>
<p>Reinforce Item: this option will allow the spellcaster to make a normal weapon or shield unbreakable for the duration of the event. This option has an additional MC of a ribbon with the words “Reinforce Item” attached to the target item. The reinforced item will not be broken by attacks that would normally damage them (e.g. a boulder hitting it) as long as the spell remains active. If disenchanted through the spell Disenchant, the ribbon must be removed and the effect will end, but the weapon will otherwise remain intact. This option may not be used on a magic item, silver weapon, or bows.</p>
<p>Restore Enchantment: this spell allows the spellcaster to restore a currently-backed Realms Magic Item that has been broken or disenchanted to working order. This option may have an additional AC of a required quest. Potions and other spell components are not subject to repair. If an item has been physically broken or made unsafe, then the item must be physically repaired or replaced with a near duplicate of the item. Note that patching or minor repairs may be acceptable instead of a full prop replacement depending on the situation. Upon informing the MM or EH of their intention to cast this spell, the EH or MM may either present to the spellcaster a quest for the completion of this spell or simply declare the item “repaired” at their discretion. The spell is wasted if the quest fails or if permission for a repair is outright denied.</p>
<p>Regenerate the Scalp (5th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: An item similar to the spellcaster’s scalp, with some sort of indication that it is their second scalp - Caveats: Regeneration, Advanced Regeneration</p>
<p>This spell grants an advanced regeneration which will return a character to life from scalping. After regenerating in this fashion, the material component becomes the spellcaster’s new scalp token.</p>
<p>Regeneration (5th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Active: Spellcaster must sit on the ground with weapons a minimum of 10 feet away while casting this spell - Caveats: Regeneration, Advanced Regeneration, Spell Failure</p>
<p>This spell grants the spellcaster an advanced regeneration. If you have learned this spell twice, you may cast a Raise Dead to “recharge” one usage. These recharges cannot come from Circle of Healing, or any other raising effects other than the Raise Dead spell.</p>
<p>Repair Armor (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Material: Disposable or focus - Active: Hold armor and MC for 15 second count</p>
<p>This spell will repair one hit location of armor. The AC should simulate physically repairing the armor, such as tapping it with a focus, like a boff-hammer.</p>
<p>Repair Item (2nd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 5 - Verbal: 20 words - Active: Touch the target item with both hands</p>
<p>This spell repairs any one normal object. It cannot be cast upon an item with a special property, such as a magic item. It can be cast to repair a weapon, shield, bow, or armor. It will repair all pieces of armor worn by someone that can be legally called in one casting. The spellcaster may have nothing else in their hands while casting this spell.</p>
<p>Resist Death (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, one at a time - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Spell Sash - Active: Kneel or lie on back, no weapons in hand. - Caveats: Enchanted Items, Spell Sash</p>
<p>The spellcaster is protected from any damaging attack for 1 hit. The call for this is “Resist Death.” The spellcaster can choose when to utilize this effect.</p>
<p>Resist Magic (5th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: 20 words</p>
<p>This spell prepares a burst of null-magic within the spellcaster. If the spellcaster so desires, they may ignore a single magical effect. This ability can be used at any time, whether the spellcaster is dead or not. A spellcaster may not be under the effect of more than one Resist Magic spell at the same time. When targeted by a spell or effect against which Resist Magic protects them and the spellcaster wishes to ignore the effect, they call “Resist Magic.” This spell will allow the spellcaster to treat a blow from a magic weapon as if it were a normal weapon blow, ignore the effect of any spell when it is first cast, or cross the boundary of a Circle of Protection. The spell ends if the spell Disenchant is cast upon the spellcaster (although the spellcaster can use the Resist Magic to prevent the Disenchant from removing any other spells upon them). This spell cannot be cast on anyone other than the spellcaster and will only protect the spellcaster, not anything they have or possess.</p>
<p>Ritual of Banishment (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Special, see below - Verbal: 40 words in “burst” form, otherwise special, see below</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to use their knowledge of magic and the planes to shift a creature back to its home dimension or to scatter the magic of a being. The spellcaster has two ways of performing this ritual. If not given time to prepare a stronger ritual, the spellcaster may simply use this spell in a “burst” fashion. To do so, the spellcaster must get the attention of the creature and say the 40 words, which must begin with “I banish you to the place from which you came…” During the casting of the spell, the spellcaster is still open to any retaliation from the creature being banished.</p>
<p>If given more time, the spellcaster can craft a more potent spell to send a creature to its home plane or</p>
<p>strip the being of magics, potentially weakening it in the process. The player may do so by performing a ritual in front of the MM or EH. By reading the available magic and essences of the creature, this ritual may grant the spellcaster knowledge and further steps that can be taken to banish or weaken the creature, possibly leading to the final incantation. After the initial casting of the ritual, this spell is unleashed when the spellcaster uses the researched magic upon the creature. The prepared spell may only be good for one attempt, whether successful or not. Greater success in crafting this magic may be achieved through knowledge of the True Name of the creature, a physical or magical part of it or through a particularly potent ritual.</p>
<p>Players who use drama and theatrics in their ritual are more likely of achieving better results. This spell will only function upon NPCs. Once this spell is attempted upon a creature, either in short or long formats, the spellcaster may not cast this spell again for an hour. You are encouraged to use a small timepiece to keep track of this time. Creatures that are shown to be too powerful from the preparation ritual do not weaken the spellcaster. You may not begin a preparation ritual on the same day as an uncompleted previous spell. Upon completion of a more in-depth ritual, the spellcaster should ask the EH or MM how long this spell is exhausted for, which may be the rest of the day. If you know this spell, you must inform the EH or MM at check-in.</p>
<p>Séance (4th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 20 words to start - Material: 3-minute hourglass/timer.</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to have an extended discussion with a spirit, either one of another world or of a scalped character. Upon informing the EH or MM of their intent to cast this spell, the spellcaster must start the ritual by flipping the hourglass. If the spirit does not arrive within the first three minutes, then the casting is not used. If the spirit arrives, let the glass run out and flip it again. The spellcaster and spirit may then speak freely until all the sands have fallen. If the spirit stays longer than three minutes, the spellcaster may continue to converse with it. Please note that this spell does not change any behavior on the part of the spirit, and it may choose not to talk.</p>
<p>Whether a scalped character can answer is entirely up to the discretion of the EH or MM, who must be present for the ritual. This spell in no way grants the knowledge of the circumstances of a scalped character’s death. If they are allowed to be contacted, the scalped PC can still refuse to answer, is not compelled to speak, can lie or tell the truth freely, and can end the séance at any time. A PC contacted with a séance must leave after three minutes.</p>
<p>Second Chance (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: A token with the spellcaster’s name</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to recover once, even from the most grievous of wounds and situations.</p>
<p>Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster must give their token to the MM. At any time afterwards, the spellcaster may activate the spell, which removes them from play. They must then go find the MM. All stealable items in possession of the spellcaster must be left behind. This spell may be activated even if the spellcaster is dead or scalped.</p>
<p>The MM will then place them somewhere on site (location determined by the MM) and return the token. Upon being placed, the spellcaster is alive and unwounded, and is given back their soul if they were scalped.</p>
<p>Seed of Life (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, while spellcaster has MC handy - Verbal: 30 words and an explanation - Material: 1 token with the spellcaster’s name and the words “Seed of Life” on it - Caveats: Regeneration, Basic Regeneration</p>
<p>When cast on a dead body, this spell grants the recipient a basic regeneration. The spellcaster must hand the MC to the recipient when the spell is cast. The spellcaster may choose to remain with the target, and as long as the spellcaster continuously recites the verbal (explanation not required) and keeps two hands touching the target, the target will regenerate in 60 seconds instead. If the spellcaster stops the verbal or breaks contact the spell will continue as normal and the target will take the full 120 seconds to regenerate.</p>
<p>Once the spell ends, the recipient should return the MC to the spellcaster as soon as reasonably possible. Other than this, the MC is neither stealable nor transferable in any way. If the recipient is scalped, returned to life, or raised as undead, the spell ends. If the recipient is diseased, this spell will also cure them of their disease upon completion of the spell (although the regeneration time will still be doubled from the effects of the disease). This spell has no effect on the undead.</p>
<p>Shapeshifting (4th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Material: Makeup and/or mask and any disguise garb - Active: Change into disguise - Caveats: Enchanted Items</p>
<p>This allows the spellcaster to shapeshift into a humanoid monster of about their height and size. This transformation takes as long to complete as it takes the player to change into the appropriate disguise outfit. The type and features of the monster are up to the player. Once the shapeshifting is complete, the player will respond to the spell Identify as the new type of monster. This spell will mimic a general monster type, and cannot accurately impersonate a named or unique monster, or appear to be another PC. You are free however, to attempt to convince your victims that you are more important than you actually are.</p>
<p>The shapeshifted form confers no combat benefit or other NPC power, though they can appear to wear armor or carry larger weapons to complete the disguise. You may in no way signal to NPCs that you are NPCing. The shapeshifted form ends if you are killed or if any part of your disguise is disenchanted (see Disenchant).</p>
<p>In addition, at the door of the event, the player is allowed to ask the EH or MM to borrow an appropriate mask for the event in order to complete the illusion. There is no guarantee that they will be able to provide the materials, so you should bring your own.</p>
<p>Skew Divination (3rd Circle) Uses: 2 - Verbal: 30 words - Material: Scroll with a name of an item, person, group, place, or situation - Active: Give scroll to MM</p>
<p>This spell will alter the next Guidance, Fortune Tell, Precognition, Find the Path, Foretell, Séance, Vision, or Prophecy spell cast about the target at that event, giving them misinformation. How much the spell is altered is up to the MM. To cast this spell the spellcaster must write the name of the target (item, person, group, place, or situation) on a scroll, sign the scroll, and give the scroll to the MM.</p>
<p>Soul Bane (3rd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1 - Active: Scalp a dead body. Following the final scalping blow the spellcaster says “Soul Bane.”</p>
<p>This spell alters the next Call the Soul cast on the target by reversing which object is successful and unsuccessful. The spellcaster must inform the MM who they scalped and cast Soul Bane on as soon possible. The effect triggers the next time the target’s soul is called. The spell ends after the first Call the Soul, whether it was successful or not. Only one Soul Bane can be active on a person at a time.</p>
<p>Speak (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Verbal: “Speak, friend…” - Material: An offering for the creature to be spoken with - Active: The spellcaster approaches the creature with no weapons and with an offering in plain sight, and hands it to the monster</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to approach a creature and present an offering to them. If the offering is taken, the creature now has the ability to speak and understand the language of the spellcaster. This ability lasts until the creature is no longer in possession of the offering. No creature approached has to take the offering, nor is there any guarantee that the creature will speak to you.</p>
<p>Speak with Dead (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 10 - Verbal: An explanation, followed by a question - Caveats: Compulsion</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to ask a corpse one “yes or no” question. The corpse may only answer “Yes,” “No,” or “Abstain,” and it may not lie. An abstention means that the spirit cannot or does not want to answer the question. Before asking the questions, the spellcaster must explain to the corpse’s player what the acceptable responses are and that the character may not lie.</p>
<p>Strange Brew (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Special, see Alchemy - Caveats: Potions</p>
<p>You may create 2 additional types of potions listed below using Alchemy. Upon learning Strange Brew, you must write down the potions you are choosing to learn and their specific rules:</p>
<p>Potion of Acid (5 Points): Deals 200 blows to a body, only usable on non-living objects. Potion of Combat Raise Dead (4 Points): Raises a dead character, healing all of their injured limbs. Potion of Heal Limb (1 Point): Heals all damaged limbs of a living recipient Potion of Cure Disease (1 Point): Cures the target of all disease. Potion of Disenchant (3 Points): Disenchants an enchanted or magic item, as per the spell, Disenchant. Potion of Soul Snare (5 Points): Recipient’s soul is returned to them as if the spell Call the Soul was successfully cast on them and their soul was called.The MM must be present for this potion to be used. Potion of Animate Undead (5 Points): Animates a corpse as per the spell Animate Undead. The spellcaster must also provide the necessary material requirements of that spell for when the potion is administered. Treat the person who applies this potion as the controller of the undead. Potion of Animate Lesser Undead (2 Points): Animates a corpse as per spell the Animate Lesser Undead. The spellcaster must also provide the necessary material requirements of that spell for when the potion is administered. Treat the person who applies this potion as the controller of the undead.</p>
<p>This does not grant any points to alchemy.</p>
<p>Transformation (6th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 2 - Material: A pair of Transformation Claws - Caveats: Regeneration, Advanced Regeneration, Suspension</p>
<p>The spellcaster releases their inner nature. The effect is a transformation.</p>
<p>Each individual spellcaster may have a different form, but that form is consistent to the spellcaster (i.e., Matt’s altered form is different than Sally’s, but Matt’s altered form is always the same any time he shifts to it). The spell must be unlearned to alter that form.</p>
<p>A complete description of the altered form must be in the spell description. The spellcaster must alter their appearance when in the transformed state. They must wear a different tabard, makeup, prosthetics, mask, or some other major signifying indicator that they are “not quite right.” Details should also be listed in the spellcaster’s spellbook.</p>
<p>Any potions or other spells with a lingering effect cast by the spellcaster are suspended when they transform. The suspension ends when the spellcaster reverts to their common form.</p>
<p>All altered forms have the following advantages/disadvantages:</p>
<p>Has the use of florentine claws, 18" maximum. Cannot use any other weapons. Claws must be of matched length. Cannot use or manipulate anything except with those claws (after all, they’re the end of their hands). These claws do not break the spellcaster’s weapon length restriction. The claws are physical representations for the spell, and are not really there until the spell is cast. They cannot be used by anyone other than the spellcaster, and they may only use them when under the effects of the spell. The claws must be clearly labeled with the phrase “Transformation Claws” and the spellcaster’s name. The claws are not considered weapons for the purpose of Spell Failure. Furthermore, they are unbreakable and immune to the effect of a boulder, though the spellcaster is killed as normal if struck in the claws. Cannot cast any spells while in altered form, except those granted as part of the Transformation. The spellcaster may revert back to their common form, ending the spell at any time.</p>
<p>A spellcaster has 7 points to construct their altered form:</p>
<p>Armor Options:</p>
<p>Natural Armor: 1 point. Grants light armor on all hit locations. Can only be purchased once. Cannot be used in conjunction with Regenerating Armor. Regenerating Armor: 3 points. Grants light armor on all hit locations, which can be regenerated. Can only be purchased once. To activate the regenerating effect, the spellcaster must lie on their back without attacking. Once so positioned, the spellcaster must remain still for 10 seconds per damaged hit location (repairing every hit location would take 70 seconds). If interrupted before all damaged hit locations are repaired, the effect fails with no armor points regenerated. Cannot be used in conjunction with Natural Armor. Both armor options may be repaired by casting Repair Item.</p>
<p>Weapon Upgrades:</p>
<p>1 point for 2’ claws. 2 points for 2’6" claws. 3 points for 3’ claws. 4 points for 3’6" claws. Poison Weapons: 4 points. The spellcaster may call “Poison” each time they swing their claws. Armor-Piercing Weapons: 5 points. The spellcaster may call “Armor-Piercing” each time they swing their claws. Axe, Hammer, or Mace claws: 1 point. The spellcaster may call “Axe,” “Hammer,” or “Mace” each time they swing their claws. The specific call must be chosen when the form is initially created. This option may only be taken once. The claws should reflect the nature of the call chosen.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Abilities:</p>
<p>Limited Regeneration: 2 points for one use. All of the spellcaster’s limbs regenerate after 30 seconds, as an unlimited effect. Cannot be in combat while healing limbs in this fashion. The spellcaster has a single advanced regeneration. 1 point for each additional extra life beyond the first. Death Watch: 2 points. As per the spell. Immunity to Poison: 1 point. May only cast on self, otherwise as per the spell. Cure Disease: 1 point. May only cast on self, otherwise as per the spell. Heartiness: 1 point. As per the spell. Transmute Self (4th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 3 - Verbal: 10 word chant, repeated. The verbal must be chanted loudly and clearly - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension</p>
<p>This spell provides an immense amount of protection to the spellcaster, but also requires an immense amount of concentration. This spell only takes effect once the spellcaster has completed the VC once. While transmuted, the spellcaster is completely immune to all forms of damage, magical or otherwise, regardless of whether the material into which the spellcaster transmutes is vulnerable to any form of damage. It does not make the spellcaster invisible or undetectable. The spellcaster must choose what they are capable of attuning to when learning the spell. Choices are: trees, stone, or earth. To transmute, the spellcaster must embrace or lie down on the object they are capable of attuning to (so those who can attune to trees hug a tree, to stone lie on or hug a rock, or to earth lie on the ground). While transmuted, the spellcaster is “stuck” and cannot be dragged. The object the spellcaster attunes with MUST be at least as massive as the spellcaster. The spellcaster must keep their eyes closed and remain perfectly still, and they must be constantly chanting their verbal while transmuted. The spellcaster must chant loudly and clearly. If anything interrupts the spellcaster’s concentration, the spell is broken. As soon as the spellcaster moves, opens their eyes, or stops chanting, the spell ends. The spellcaster may not transmute for at least one slow 200 second count after regaining their proper form. The spellcaster should use their common sense when deciding where to transmute. Pick a safe location, not the middle of a trail or a high combat area.</p>
<p>Vision (5th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: 1</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to ask the EH or MM a question. The EH will then reveal to the spellcaster as complete a description as they are willing to give, giving them a vision relating to it.</p>
<p>Ward: Enchanted Beings (5th Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 20 words, repeated continuously, stating purpose of spell - Material: Focus - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension, Wards</p>
<p>This spell prevents Enchanted Beings from attacking the spellcaster while it is active.</p>
<p>Ward: Undead (2nd Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited - Verbal: 10 words, repeated continuously, stating purpose of spell - Material: Focus - Caveats: Chanting, Suspension, Wards</p>
<p>This spell prevents Undead from attacking the spellcaster while it is active.</p>
<p>Zombie Walk (1st Circle)</p>
<p>Uses: Unlimited, 1 at a time - Verbal: 10 words, plus an explanation - Active: Touch the target - Caveats: Undead, Walking Dead</p>
<p>This spell allows the spellcaster to animate a corpse, making it follow them for as long as they concentrate on the spell. If the spellcaster engages in combat either by attacking or by being struck, the spell ends and the corpse falls to the ground. In order to cast this spell, the spellcaster must recite the verbal and give the player of the corpse a brief explanation of what they should do, making sure they know when to fall down.</p>
